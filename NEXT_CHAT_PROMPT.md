# GitHub Copilot Agent TODO Search - Next Steps Prompt

## Current Situation Summary

We have been working on implementing a GitHub Copilot Agent that automatically searches for TODO comments in Python files when assigned to GitHub issues. Here's the current status:

### ✅ What Has Been Completed:

1. **Script Implementation**: Updated `scripts/process_agent_task.py` with TODO search functionality
2. **Workflow Configuration**: GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/copilot-agent-tasks.yml` is configured
3. **Dependencies Fixed**: Added `PyGithub>=1.55` to `requirements.txt` to fix import errors
4. **TODO Search Logic**: Implemented comprehensive TODO categorization (actual TODOs vs meta/test references)
5. **Test Data Confirmed**: Verified TODOs exist in the codebase:
   - `economy/grand_exchange.py:183`: # TODO: Implement item reservation system
   - `economy/grand_exchange.py:399`: # TODO: Return reserved items for sell offers
   - `economy/grand_exchange.py:572`: # TODO: Return reserved items for sell offers

### ⚠️ Current Issue:

The GitHub Copilot Agent workflow was triggered but appears to have failed. The workflow log showed it started but was cut off after displaying the firewall allow list. We suspect a dependency issue that should now be resolved.

### 🎯 Immediate Next Steps Required:

## STEP 1: Check Current Workflow Status

**You need to manually check these URLs (I cannot access them from VS Code):**

1. **GitHub Actions Log**: https://github.com/Giftedx/runerogue/actions
   - Find the most recent "Copilot Agent Tasks" workflow run
   - Click on the job to see the complete log
   - Look for specific error patterns:
     ```
     ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'github'
     ImportError: cannot import name 'Github'
     Error: Process completed with exit code 1
     python scripts/process_agent_task.py --issue-number 42 --repo Giftedx/runerogue
     ```

2. **GitHub Issue Comments**: https://github.com/Giftedx/runerogue/issues/42
   - Check for any comment from `github-copilot[bot]`
   - The comment should contain TODO search results if successful

## STEP 2: Test the Fixed Implementation

If the workflow still fails, run these commands to test locally:

```bash
cd /workspaces/runerogue

# Test the simple TODO search script
python3 test_todo_functionality.py

# Test our main script dependencies
python3 -c "
try:
    from github import Github
    print('✅ PyGithub imported successfully')
except ImportError as e:
    print(f'❌ PyGithub import failed: {e}')
"

# Verify requirements.txt has PyGithub
grep -i pygithub requirements.txt
```

## STEP 3: Re-trigger the Workflow

If the previous workflow failed due to the missing PyGithub dependency:

1. Go to: https://github.com/Giftedx/runerogue/issues/42
2. **Unassign** `@github/copilot` from the issue
3. Wait a moment
4. **Re-assign** `@github/copilot` to the issue
5. This will trigger the workflow again with the updated requirements.txt

## STEP 4: Expected Success Outcome

When the workflow succeeds, you should see a comment on issue #42 like this:

```markdown
## Found TODOs:

**Actual TODO Comments (requiring action):**
- `economy/grand_exchange.py:183`: # TODO: Implement item reservation system
- `economy/grand_exchange.py:399`: # TODO: Return reserved items for sell offers
- `economy/grand_exchange.py:572`: # TODO: Return reserved items for sell offers

**All TODO References:**
[... includes meta/test references from other files ...]

**Summary:** Found 3 actual TODO comments that require developer attention.
```

## STEP 5: Troubleshooting Alternatives

If the main approach still doesn't work, we have backup options:

### Option A: Alternative Workflow Approach
- Modify the workflow to use a different GitHub Copilot Agent approach
- Check if there are permission issues with the GitHub token

### Option B: Manual Testing Script
Use the simple test script we created:
```bash
python3 scripts/simple_todo_search.py
```

### Option C: Direct TODO Search
Run manual TODO search to verify results:
```bash
# Using grep
grep -rn "TODO" --include="*.py" .

# Using git grep
git grep -n "TODO" -- "*.py"
```

## 📋 Key Files to Reference:

- **Main Script**: `scripts/process_agent_task.py` (lines 120-122 for TODO detection, line 284+ for _search_todos method)
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/copilot-agent-tasks.yml`
- **Requirements**: `requirements.txt` (should include PyGithub>=1.55)
- **Test Script**: `test_todo_functionality.py`
- **Target Issue**: https://github.com/Giftedx/runerogue/issues/42

## 🔍 Diagnostic Questions to Answer:

1. Did the GitHub Actions workflow complete or fail?
2. What specific error messages appear in the workflow log?
3. Is there a comment from github-copilot[bot] on issue #42?
4. Does the local TODO search test work?

## 📊 Success Criteria:

- ✅ GitHub Copilot Agent posts a comment on issue #42
- ✅ Comment contains categorized TODO search results
- ✅ Workflow completes without errors
- ✅ Self-hosted runner processes the task successfully

## 🚨 If You Need Further Help:

If any step fails or produces unexpected results, provide:
1. The complete error message from GitHub Actions logs
2. The current status of issue #42 (any comments present)
3. Results from running the local test commands
4. Any other error messages encountered

This will help diagnose and resolve any remaining issues with the GitHub Copilot Agent TODO search functionality.

---

**Context**: This is a continuation of implementing a GitHub Copilot Agent that automatically processes TODO search requests when assigned to GitHub issues. The agent should run on a self-hosted runner and post results as issue comments.
