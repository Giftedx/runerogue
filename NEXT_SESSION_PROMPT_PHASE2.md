# RuneRogue Development Continuation - Phase 2

## üéØ **MISSION: Enhanced Client Development & ECS Migration**

**Context**: Phase 1 stabilization is COMPLETE! We now have a working prototype with basic multiplayer functionality. The next phase focuses on building a sophisticated client and migrating to the advanced ECS server.

## üèÜ **PHASE 1 ACHIEVEMENTS (COMPLETED)**

### ‚úÖ **WORKING PROTOTYPE**

- **Server**: `packages/game-server` fully functional on port 2567
- **Client**: Minimal HTML/JS client with real-time multiplayer
- **Testing**: End-to-end connection and movement working
- **Foundation**: All core packages stable and tested

### üìä **Current Package Status**

- ‚úÖ `@runerogue/game-server`: Working (3/3 tests, server running)
- ‚úÖ `@runerogue/shared`: Working (schemas exported correctly)
- ‚úÖ `@runerogue/osrs-data`: Excellent (41/41 tests passing)
- üîÑ `@runerogue/server`: Advanced ECS (TypeScript fixed, some test issues)
- ‚ùå `client/`: TypeScript build errors (complex features, needs simplification)
- ‚úÖ `minimal-client.html`: Working prototype client

## üéØ **PHASE 2 PRIORITIES**

### **CRITICAL: Enhanced Client Development**

#### 2.1 **Fix TypeScript Client Build**

**Current Issues**: 35 TypeScript errors in client package
**Root Causes**:

- Discord SDK version compatibility issues
- Missing environment variable types
- Phaser integration errors
- Colyseus schema integration mismatches

**APPROACH**:

1. Simplify client to match working minimal client functionality
2. Fix core TypeScript and dependency issues
3. Gradually add advanced features

#### 2.2 **Discord Activity Integration**

**Goal**: Deploy as proper Discord Activity
**Requirements**:

- Fix Discord SDK compatibility (currently v1.2.0, may need upgrade)
- Implement OAuth2 flow correctly
- Create Discord Activity manifest
- Handle environment variables properly

### **HIGH: Server Architecture Evolution**

#### 2.3 **ECS Server Migration Planning**

**Current State**:

- `packages/game-server`: Simple but working (current production)
- `packages/server`: Advanced ECS with bitECS (development)

**Migration Strategy**:

1. **Phase 2A**: Keep using simple server while fixing client
2. **Phase 2B**: Gradually migrate features to ECS server
3. **Phase 2C**: Switch to ECS server as primary

#### 2.4 **Test Infrastructure Stabilization**

**Issues**: 65/265 tests failing, mostly due to:

- Colyseus testing framework compatibility
- Some ECS integration test issues
- Schema inconsistencies in tests

### **MEDIUM: Feature Development**

#### 2.5 **Advanced Game Features**

- Complete OSRS combat mechanics
- Wave-based enemy spawning
- Player progression and persistence
- Enhanced multiplayer interactions

## üîß **SPECIFIC EXECUTION PLAN**

### **Step 1: Client Architecture Simplification**

1. **Create Working TypeScript Client**:

   ```bash
   cd client
   # Remove complex features causing build errors
   # Start with minimal TypeScript version of working HTML client
   # Add features incrementally
   ```

2. **Fix Core Dependencies**:

   - Update Discord SDK to compatible version
   - Fix environment variable typing
   - Resolve Phaser integration issues

3. **Environment Setup**:

   ```bash
   # Create proper .env files
   # Fix import.meta.env typing
   # Ensure Vite configuration is correct
   ```

### **Step 2: Discord Activity Deployment**

1. **Discord Configuration**:

   - Create Discord Application
   - Configure OAuth2 settings
   - Test embedded app deployment

2. **SDK Integration**:
   - Fix Discord SDK version compatibility
   - Implement proper authentication flow
   - Handle user management

### **Step 3: ECS Migration Preparation**

1. **Test Suite Stabilization**:

   ```bash
   cd packages/server
   # Fix Colyseus testing issues
   # Resolve schema test conflicts
   # Get test suite to 100% passing
   ```

2. **Feature Comparison**:
   - Document differences between simple and ECS servers
   - Plan migration strategy
   - Identify breaking changes

## üìã **FILES TO EXAMINE/MODIFY**

### **Immediate Priority**

- `client/src/` - Simplify TypeScript client
- `client/package.json` - Fix dependencies
- `client/.env` - Environment configuration

### **Medium Priority**

- `packages/server/src/server/__tests__/` - Fix failing tests
- `packages/server/src/server/rooms/` - ECS room implementation

### **Lower Priority**

- Discord Activity manifest creation
- Production deployment configuration

## üöÄ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **Phase 2A Complete When**

- ‚úÖ TypeScript client builds without errors
- ‚úÖ Discord Activity integration working
- ‚úÖ Feature parity with minimal client but in proper architecture

### **Phase 2B Complete When**

- ‚úÖ ECS server test suite passing
- ‚úÖ Migration path clearly defined
- ‚úÖ Advanced features implemented

### **Phase 2C Complete When**

- ‚úÖ Production-ready Discord Activity
- ‚úÖ ECS server as primary
- ‚úÖ Full multiplayer game functionality

## üí° **KEY INSIGHTS & STRATEGY**

### **What's Working Well**

1. **OSRS Data**: Excellent foundation with comprehensive combat formulas
2. **Simple Server**: Proves multiplayer architecture works
3. **Schema Design**: Clean separation between packages
4. **Testing**: Good coverage where it works

### **Strategic Approach**

1. **Incremental Enhancement**: Build on working foundation
2. **Parallel Development**: Fix client while preparing ECS migration
3. **Practical Focus**: Prioritize working features over perfect architecture

### **Risk Mitigation**

- Keep simple server as fallback
- Test all changes incrementally
- Maintain working prototype throughout development

## üìà **DEVELOPMENT VELOCITY ACCELERATORS**

1. **Working Foundation**: No longer fighting basic connectivity
2. **Clear Architecture**: Defined packages and responsibilities
3. **Test Coverage**: Good safety net for changes
4. **Documentation**: Current state well-understood

---

**START HERE**: Begin with fixing TypeScript client build errors. Focus on getting `client/` package to build successfully with basic functionality, then gradually add advanced features.

**CONTEXT FILES**:

- `minimal-client.html` (working reference implementation)
- `client/src/` (TypeScript client to fix)
- `packages/game-server/` (working server reference)
- `packages/server/` (advanced ECS server target)

The foundation is solid and working. Execute this plan systematically and RuneRogue will become a production-ready Discord Activity with sophisticated multiplayer gameplay.

**CURRENT STATUS: PROTOTYPE WORKING ‚Üí NEXT: PRODUCTION READY**
