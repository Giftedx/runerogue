   - Real-time enemy targeting and AI
   - XP progression with visual feedback

3. **Multiplayer GameRoom Enhancement**

   - Player join/leave handling
   - State synchronization via Colyseus
   - Performance optimization for 4+ players

4. **Client-Server Integration**
   - WebSocket connection management
   - Real-time rendering and UI updates
   - Input handling with validation

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION FOCUS**

### **Server-Side Development (Primary):**

```
packages/game-server/src/
├── rooms/GameRoom.ts           # Enhanced multiplayer room
├── systems/MovementSystem.ts   # Real-time movement
├── systems/AutoCombatSystem.ts # Combat integration
├── schema/GameRoomState.ts     # State management
└── handlers/InputHandlers.ts   # Message processing
```

### **Client-Side Development (Secondary):**

```
server-ts/src/client/
├── game/GameClient.ts          # Colyseus connection
├── game/GameRenderer.ts        # Rendering system
├── ui/HealthBar.ts             # Visual feedback
└── networking/StateSync.ts     # Synchronization
```

## 💡 **DEVELOPMENT APPROACH**

### **Recommended Order:**

1. **Server Foundation (60 minutes):**

   - Enhance GameRoom with ECS integration
   - Implement MovementSystem with validation
   - Add AutoCombatSystem integration

2. **Client Integration (90 minutes):**

   - Set up Colyseus client connection
   - Add real-time rendering and interpolation
   - Implement input handling and prediction

3. **Gameplay Systems (60 minutes):**

   - Player progression and XP systems
   - Inventory and equipment management
   - Enemy spawning and AI behavior

4. **Testing & Polish (30 minutes):**
   - 2-4 player scenario testing
   - Performance validation
   - OSRS authenticity verification

## 🚨 **CRITICAL REMINDERS**

### **Development Principles:**

- **OSRS Authenticity First:** All mechanics must match OSRS Wiki exactly
- **Server Authority:** All game logic validated server-side
- **Performance Focus:** Target 60fps client, 20 TPS server
- **Multiplayer Stability:** Handle disconnections gracefully

### **Available Tools:**

- Use existing OSRS data from packages/osrs-data extensively
- Leverage ECS components already implemented
- Test with multiple browser tabs for multiplayer simulation
- Monitor performance with built-in profiling tools
