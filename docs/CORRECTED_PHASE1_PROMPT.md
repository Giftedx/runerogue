# RuneRogue Phase 1 Implementation - Corrected Status and Next Steps

I'm working on RuneRogue, an OSRS-inspired multiplayer roguelike survival game for Discord. Based on the actual codebase analysis, here's the current state and what needs to be done:

## Actual Project Structure

```

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Working Components

- **OSRS Data Pipeline**: Complete with authentic combat formulas, serving via Express API
- **Multiplayer Infrastructure**: Colyseus rooms and basic schemas implemented
- **Game Server**: Core implementation in packages/server with game logic and state management
- **Package Structure**: Proper monorepo with pnpm workspaces and Lerna coordination
- **Basic Clients**: Multiple Phaser demo implementations, Godot client started

### ⚠️ Current Issues

- **Test Coverage**: 27 passing, 79 failing tests (mostly archived legacy tests with missing dependencies)
- **Client Integration**: Neither Phaser nor Godot clients are properly connected to the multiplayer server
- **Code Cleanup**: Many archived test files with broken imports need cleanup
- **Documentation**: Previous docs referenced incorrect architecture and missing components

### 🎯 Immediate Priorities

## Phase 1A: Stabilization (Current Focus)

### 1. Test Suite Cleanup

- Fix or remove the 79 failing archived tests with broken imports
- Focus on stabilizing the 27 passing tests in core packages
- Separate working tests from legacy/archived test files
- Establish reliable CI/CD pipeline

### 2. Client-Server Integration

- Connect the working Phaser client demos to the Colyseus server
- Implement proper WebSocket connection and state synchronization
- Test multiplayer functionality with 2-4 players
- Choose primary client approach (Phaser web vs Godot native)

### 3. Core Gameplay Loop

- Implement basic player movement and server synchronization
- Add simple combat mechanics using the OSRS formulas
- Create basic UI showing player health and game state
- Ensure 60fps performance with multiple players

## Phase 1B: Feature Completion

### 4. Enhanced Multiplayer Features

- Player spawning and respawning system
- Basic enemy AI and spawning mechanics
- Real-time combat visualization
- Simple progression and XP system

### 5. Discord Activity Integration

- Configure Discord Activity manifest
- Implement Discord SDK initialization
- Handle party/invite system through Discord
- Test activity in Discord environment

## Technical Notes

### Package Commands

```bash
# Start all development servers
pnpm dev

# Run stable tests only
pnpm test --testPathIgnorePatterns="archived"

# Work on specific packages
pnpm --filter @runerogue/osrs-data dev
pnpm --filter @runerogue/game-server dev
```

### Key Files to Focus On

- `packages/osrs-data/src/` - Combat calculation APIs (working)
- `packages/game-server/src/` - Colyseus room implementation
- `packages/server/src/` - Main game server logic
- `packages/phaser-client/` - Web client demos to connect
- `client/godot/` - Alternative client implementation

### Known Working Features

- OSRS combat damage calculations
- Express API serving game data
- Basic Colyseus room creation
- Multiple Phaser client demos (not connected)
- Proper TypeScript configuration across packages

## Success Criteria for Phase 1

1. **Stable Tests**: All core package tests passing, archived tests cleaned up
2. **Connected Clients**: At least one client (Phaser or Godot) successfully connected to server
3. **Multiplayer Demo**: 2+ players can join a room, move around, and see each other
4. **Combat System**: Players can attack enemies using authentic OSRS calculations
5. **Performance**: Maintains 60fps with 4 players and basic gameplay

The foundation is solid with working OSRS data pipeline and multiplayer infrastructure. The main gap is connecting the clients to the server and stabilizing the test suite. Focus on getting one complete client-server integration working before expanding features.
