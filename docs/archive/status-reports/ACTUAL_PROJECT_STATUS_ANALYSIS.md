# RuneRogue: Actual Project Status vs. Documentation Analysis

**Analysis Date:** Current
**Status:** CRITICAL DISCREPANCIES IDENTIFIED

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL FINDINGS: DOCUMENTATION VS. REALITY**

### **Documentation Claims Multiple Contradictory States:**

1. **PHASE_1_DEVELOPMENT_PROMPT.md:**

   - Claims: "✅ PHASE 0 FOUNDATION - 100% COMPLETE AND VERIFIED"
   - Claims: "✅ ALL OSRS combat formulas implemented and tested (13/13 tests passing)"
   - Claims: "✅ Colyseus server operational on port 2567"

2. **ORCHESTRATION_STATUS.md:**

   - Claims: "Current Phase: Phase 0 - Foundation & Data Pipeline"
   - Claims: "Phase Progress: 25% (1/4 tasks complete)"

3. **ACTUAL REALITY:**
   - osrs-data tests: **FAILING** with TypeScript signature errors
   - server-ts tests: **15 FAILED, 24 PASSED** with Colyseus schema errors
   - Multiple critical systems non-functional

---

## 📁 **ARCHITECTURE: PLANNED VS. ACTUAL**

### **Planned Structure (from RUNEROGUE_PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md):**

```
packages/
├── osrs-data/           # ✅ EXISTS (but tests failing)
├── game-engine/         # ❌ MISSING - main logic in server-ts instead
├── discord-client/      # ❌ MISSING - client is Godot, not Phaser 3
├── game-server/         # ✅ EXISTS (minimal implementation)
└── shared/             # ✅ EXISTS (minimal implementation)
```

### **Actual Structure:**

```
packages/
├── osrs-data/          # Exists but tests failing
├── game-server/        # Basic structure only
└── shared/             # Minimal implementation

server-ts/              # MAIN IMPLEMENTATION (not in planned docs)
├── src/server/ecs/     # Comprehensive ECS system
├── src/server/game/    # GameRoom, schemas, combat
└── __tests__/          # Extensive test suite (many failing)

client/godot/           # Godot client (planned was Phaser 3 + React)
```

## 🔥 **CRITICAL TECHNICAL BLOCKERS**

### **Priority 1: Foundation Failures**

- **osrs-data combat.test.ts:** Function signature mismatches preventing tests
- **server-ts GameRoom:** Player join failures (players not added to state)
- **Inventory System:** Initialization failures, undefined properties

### **Priority 2: Colyseus Schema Issues**

- **Persistent Symbol.metadata errors:** "Cannot read properties of undefined"
- **ArraySchema registration warnings:** Multiple duplicate registration attempts
- **Trade/Loot systems:** All failing due to schema serialization errors

### **Priority 3: ECS Integration Issues**

- **Combat System:** Not awarding XP, combat actions returning null
- **Movement System:** Position updates not persisting
- **Health/Prayer Systems:** Event applications not working

---

## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN**

### **Phase 1: Foundation Repair (Priority: CRITICAL)**

1. **Fix osrs-data function signatures:**

   - Update `calculateMaxHit()` and `calculateAccuracy()` function calls
   - Ensure all tests pass in packages/osrs-data/

2. **Resolve Colyseus schema errors:**

   - Fix Symbol.metadata polyfill implementation
   - Resolve ArraySchema registration conflicts
   - Ensure player join/state management works

3. **Fix inventory initialization:**
   - Ensure players get proper inventory on join
   - Fix inventory property access issues
   - Test basic item management

### **Phase 2: Core Gameplay (Priority: HIGH)**

1. **Fix ECS integration:**

   - Resolve combat system XP awarding
   - Fix movement/position persistence
   - Ensure health/prayer systems work

2. **Stabilize multiplayer:**
   - Fix player join/leave functionality
   - Resolve state synchronization issues
   - Test 2-4 player scenarios

### **Phase 3: Documentation Alignment (Priority: MEDIUM)**

1. **Update all planning documents:**

   - Reflect actual architecture (server-ts as main implementation)
   - Correct technology choices (Godot vs. Phaser 3)
   - Align status documents with reality

2. **Create accurate project roadmap:**
   - Define realistic completion criteria
   - Establish actual test pass rates
   - Document known limitations and workarounds

---

## 📊 **CURRENT METRICS**

### **Test Results:**

- **packages/osrs-data:** 0/? tests passing (TypeScript errors)
- **server-ts:** 24/39 tests passing (61.5% pass rate)
- **Target:** >90% pass rate for Phase 1 completion

### **Critical Systems Status:**

- **Player Management:** ❌ BROKEN (join failures)
- **Inventory System:** ❌ BROKEN (initialization issues)
- **Combat System:** ⚠️ PARTIAL (some tests pass, XP/actions fail)
- **Movement System:** ⚠️ PARTIAL (basic movement, persistence issues)
- **Trade/Loot Systems:** ❌ BROKEN (schema serialization failures)

### **Architecture Completion:**

- **ECS Components:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED (14 components)
- **ECS Systems:** ⚠️ PARTIAL (10 systems, integration issues)
- **Colyseus Integration:** ❌ BROKEN (schema errors)
- **Client Implementation:** ❌ MINIMAL (Godot project exists, not integrated)

## 🔧 **NEXT STEPS - EXECUTION ORDER**

1. **IMMEDIATE (Next 2 hours):**

   - Fix osrs-data function signature errors
   - Resolve basic Colyseus player join functionality
   - Get inventory initialization working

2. **SHORT TERM (Next 6 hours):**

   - Stabilize Colyseus schema serialization
   - Fix ECS combat system integration
   - Achieve >80% test pass rate

3. **MEDIUM TERM (Next 1-2 days):**
   - Integrate client-server communication
   - Implement basic multiplayer gameplay
   - Update all documentation to reflect reality

---

## 🎮 **REALISTIC PHASE 1 GOALS**

Given the current state, a realistic Phase 1 completion should include:

- ✅ Stable player join/leave functionality
- ✅ Working inventory system (28 slots, basic items)
- ✅ Functional movement with server validation
- ✅ Basic combat system with authentic OSRS calculations
- ✅ >90% server-ts test pass rate
- ✅ 2-4 player multiplayer testing scenarios

**Estimated Timeline:** 2-3 days of focused debugging and integration work
