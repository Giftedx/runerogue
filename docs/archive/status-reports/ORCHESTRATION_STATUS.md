## 📋 Phase Breakdown

### Phase 0: Foundation & Data Pipeline (25% Complete)

**Goal:** Establish data pipeline, server infrastructure, and testing framework

| Task                  | Agent               | Status      | Dependencies   | Blocks  |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ----------- | -------------- | ------- |
| 1. Project Structure  | Master Orchestrator | ✅ COMPLETE | -              | -       |
| 2. OSRS Data Pipeline | agent/osrs-data     | 🔄 PENDING  | -              | Phase 1 |
| 3. Colyseus Server    | agent/backend-infra | 🔄 PENDING  | -              | Phase 1 |
| 4. Test Framework     | agent/qa-tester     | 🔄 PENDING  | Task 2, Task 3 | Phase 1 |

**Critical Path:** Task 2 → Task 4 → Phase 1  
**Parallel Work:** Task 3 can run alongside Task 2

### Phase 1: Core Gameplay Vertical Slice (Planned)

**Goal:** Basic player movement, combat, and enemy interaction

| Task                 | Agent                  | Status     | Dependencies         |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| 1. Game Canvas       | agent/engine-client    | ⏸️ WAITING | Phase 0 complete     |
| 2. Player Sync       | agent/gameplay-systems | ⏸️ WAITING | Phase 0 complete     |
| 3. Player Movement   | agent/engine-client    | ⏸️ WAITING | Task 1, 2            |
| 4. Automated Combat  | agent/gameplay-systems | ⏸️ WAITING | OSRS data ready      |
| 5. Enemy AI          | agent/gameplay-systems | ⏸️ WAITING | OSRS data ready      |
| 6. Combat Validation | agent/qa-tester        | ⏸️ WAITING | Test framework ready |

### Future Phases (Outlined)

- **Phase 2:** Full Gameplay Loop (XP, leveling, upgrades)
