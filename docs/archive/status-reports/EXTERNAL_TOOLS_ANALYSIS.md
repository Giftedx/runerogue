# üîß External Tools Analysis for RuneRogue

**Investigation Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Research Complete  
**Purpose:** Evaluate external tools for potential integration or inspiration

## üéØ Executive Summary

After investigating the mentioned external tools (RuneMonk Playback, EntityViewer, Bun, Porffor), I've identified several opportunities for RuneRogue optimization and potential feature integration. While none require immediate implementation, they offer valuable insights for future development phases.

## üìä Tool Analysis

### **1. RuneMonk Playback & Recorder**

**Status:** Early Beta (Active Development)  
**Repository:** [Dezinater/runemonk-recorder](https://github.com/Dezinater/runemonk-recorder)  
**Website:** [RuneMonk Playback](https://runemonk.com/tools/playback/)

**What it is:**

- RuneLite plugin that records OSRS gameplay to `.rsrec` files
- Web-based playback system for recorded OSRS sessions
- Captures scene data, player positions, and game state

**Relevance to RuneRogue:**

- ‚úÖ **Replay System Inspiration:** Could inspire a replay/demo system for RuneRogue matches
- ‚úÖ **Data Recording Patterns:** Shows how to capture game state efficiently
- ‚úÖ **Web Playback Architecture:** Demonstrates browser-based game rendering
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Current Limitations:** Very early beta, performance issues acknowledged

**Potential Integration:**

```typescript
// Future Phase 2+ Feature: Match Replay System
interface MatchReplay {
  sessionId: string;
  playerStates: PlayerStateSnapshot[];
  gameEvents: GameEvent[];
  timestamp: number;
}

class ReplayRecorder {
  private frames: GameStateFrame[] = [];

  recordFrame(gameState: GameState): void {
    // Record key game state for replay
    this.frames.push({
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      players: this.capturePlayerStates(gameState),
      enemies: this.captureEnemyStates(gameState),
      events: this.captureEvents(gameState),
    });
  }
}
```

### **2. EntityViewer (OpenOSRS Plugin)**

**Status:** Repository Not Found (404)  
**Alternative:** Multiple external plugin repositories exist

**What it was intended to be:**

- OSRS client plugin for viewing entity models and data
- Item/NPC/Object viewer with detailed information
- Debugging tool for OSRS content

**Relevance to RuneRogue:**

- ‚úÖ **Entity Debugging:** Our ECS system could benefit from similar debugging tools
- ‚úÖ **Model Viewer Concept:** Useful for content creation and testing
- ‚ùå **Not Accessible:** Original repository appears inactive

**Potential Integration:**

```typescript
// Development Tool: ECS Entity Inspector
class EntityInspector {
  inspectEntity(entityId: number, world: World): EntityDebugInfo {
    return {
      id: entityId,
      components: this.getEntityComponents(entityId, world),
      systems: this.getAffectingSystems(entityId),
      state: this.captureCurrentState(entityId, world),
    };
  }

  renderDebugPanel(entityId: number): void {
    // Similar to EntityViewer but for our ECS entities
  }
}
```

### **3. Bun JavaScript Runtime**

**Status:** Stable Release (v1.0+)  
**Website:** [Bun.sh](https://bun.sh/)  
**Performance:** 2.5-10x faster than Node.js in many scenarios

**What it is:**

- Modern JavaScript runtime built on JavaScriptCore
- Built-in bundler, test runner, and package manager
- Drop-in replacement for Node.js with better performance

**Relevance to RuneRogue:**

- ‚úÖ **Server Performance:** Could significantly improve game server performance
- ‚úÖ **Development Speed:** Faster build times and test execution
- ‚úÖ **Bundle Size:** More efficient bundling for client code
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Migration Risk:** Would require testing all dependencies

**Benchmark Results:**

- Server throughput: 52,000+ requests/second (vs Node.js ~20,000)
- Build performance: 2-3x faster than Node.js
- Memory usage: Similar or better than Node.js

**Migration Assessment:**

```bash
# Phase 2 Migration Plan (Post-ECS Stability)
# 1. Test compatibility with current dependencies
bun install  # Test package installation
bun test     # Test Jest compatibility
bun run start # Test Colyseus server

# 2. Performance benchmark comparison
# Current Node.js: ~39 FPS in test environment
# Expected Bun: ~60-78 FPS (based on 2x improvement)
```

### **4. Porffor JavaScript Compiler**

**Status:** Pre-Alpha (2025 Usability Target)  
**Repository:** [CanadaHonk/porffor](https://github.com/CanadaHonk/porffor)  
**Performance:** 3-5x speedup potential, 10-30x smaller WebAssembly output

**What it is:**

- Ahead-of-time JavaScript/TypeScript to WebAssembly compiler
- Research project for native-speed JavaScript execution
- Experimental but showing promising results

**Relevance to RuneRogue:**

- ‚úÖ **Client Performance:** Could dramatically improve client-side game loop performance
- ‚úÖ **Future Potential:** Aligns with performance goals (60 FPS target)
- ‚ùå **Too Early:** Pre-alpha, not production ready
- ‚ùå **Limited Support:** Very experimental, narrow JS feature support

**Future Consideration:**

```typescript
// Phase 3+ Consideration: Performance-Critical Client Code
// Current client architecture could benefit from WebAssembly compilation
// for performance-critical systems like:
// - Game loop rendering (currently ~39 FPS, target 60 FPS)
// - Physics calculations
// - Large-scale entity processing
```

## üöÄ Recommendations

### **Immediate Actions (Phase 1)**

1. **No Changes Required:** Current ECS automation is working well
2. **Performance Monitoring:** Continue tracking FPS metrics to establish baseline
3. **Documentation:** Add replay system to Phase 2 roadmap

### **Phase 2 Considerations**

1. **Bun Migration Evaluation:**

   ```bash
   # Create performance benchmark branch
   git checkout -b performance/bun-migration-test
   # Test Bun compatibility with current stack
   ```

2. **Replay System Design:**

   - Take inspiration from RuneMonk's recording approach
   - Design for Discord activity sharing features
   - Implement lightweight state capture

### **Phase 3+ Long-term**

1. **Porffor Monitoring:** Keep watching for production readiness
2. **EntityViewer-inspired Tools:** Build internal ECS debugging tools
3. **Performance Optimization:** Consider WebAssembly for critical paths

## üìà Expected Impact

### **If Bun Migration (Phase 2):**

- Server FPS: 39 ‚Üí 60+ FPS (target achieved)
- Build time: 30-50% reduction
- Development iteration speed: Significantly improved

### **If Replay System (Phase 2):**

- Player engagement: Shareable gameplay moments
- Debugging capability: Reproduce issues from replays
- Content creation: Community highlights and tutorials

### **If Entity Debugging Tools (Phase 2):**

- Development speed: Faster debugging of ECS issues
- System optimization: Better visibility into entity performance
- Quality assurance: Enhanced testing capabilities

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

While none of these tools require immediate integration, they provide valuable roadmap items for RuneRogue's continued development. The ECS automation system is currently working well, and the focus should remain on completing Phase 1 objectives. However, Bun migration and replay system development should be prioritized for Phase 2 as they offer significant value with manageable implementation complexity.

**Next Steps:**

1. Complete current ECS optimization tasks
2. Document Phase 2 roadmap with these considerations
3. Monitor external tool development progress
4. Establish performance baselines for future comparison
