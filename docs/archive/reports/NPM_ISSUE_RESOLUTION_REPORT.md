# NPM Package Management Issue Resolution Report

## Issue Summary

The RuneRogue server was failing to start due to npm package management errors. The error "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'package')" indicated corrupted package metadata causing npm operations to fail.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Corrupted dependency files**: Files named `=3.0.0` and `=5.3.0` were present in the root directory, containing Python pip installation output that had been redirected incorrectly. These files were confusing npm's package resolution.

2. **Package manager mismatch**: The project uses pnpm (as evidenced by `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `pnpm-workspace.yaml`), but attempts were made to use npm directly in workspace subpackages.

3. **Workspace dependency resolution**: The project uses workspace dependencies (`"@runerogue/shared": "workspace:*"`) which require proper monorepo tooling.

4. **TypeScript types issue**: `@types/phaser` dependency was not available in the npm registry, causing pnpm installation to fail.

5. **Path resolution issue**: The start script had incorrect relative path resolution that was being interpreted from the wrong working directory.

## Resolution Steps Taken

### 1. Removed Corrupted Files

- Identified and removed `=3.0.0` and `=5.3.0` files that contained corrupted pip installation output

### 2. Fixed Package Manager Usage

- Switched from npm to pnpm for workspace management
- Used `pnpm install` from the root directory to properly handle workspace dependencies

### 3. Resolved Dependency Issues

- Removed problematic `@types/phaser` dependency from `server-ts/package.json`
- Relied on existing custom Phaser type definitions in `src/types/phaser.d.ts`

### 4. Fixed Start Script

- Updated the start script in `server-ts/package.json` to use proper working directory and path resolution
- Changed from: `"node dist/server-ts/src/server/working-server.js"`
- Changed to: `"cd C:\\Users\\aggis\\GitHub\\runerogue\\server-ts && node dist\\server-ts\\src\\server\\working-server.js"`

## Current Status

✅ **RESOLVED**: Server starts successfully and runs on port 3000
✅ **VERIFIED**: All enhanced Phaser clients are accessible and functional:

- Basic test client: http://localhost:3000/test-client.html
- Enhanced client: http://localhost:3000/enhanced-client.html
- Ultimate enhanced client: http://localhost:3000/ultimate-enhanced.html

## Server Output

```
🚀 Starting Working RuneRogue Server...
📍 Environment: development
🔌 Port: 3000
✅ RuneRogue Server started successfully!
🌐 HTTP: http://localhost:3000
🎮 WebSocket: ws://localhost:3000
🔗 Game: ws://localhost:3000/runerogue
🧪 Test Client: http://localhost:3000/test-client.html
```

## Technical Notes

- The project is a pnpm workspace with multiple packages
- Dependencies are properly resolved via workspace protocol
- Custom Phaser types are sufficient for TypeScript compilation
- All Phase 3 enhanced clients remain functional

## Recommendations

1. Use pnpm consistently for all package management operations
2. Run package commands from the root directory when dealing with workspace dependencies
3. Consider adding npm/pnpm scripts to the root package.json for common server operations
4. Document the monorepo structure and package manager requirements in README

## Next Steps

With the server now running properly, development can continue on:

- Phase 4 implementation (advanced OSRS systems, enhanced multiplayer)
- Further client optimizations and polish
- Testing and validation framework improvements
- Production deployment preparation

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Server operational, ready for continued development
