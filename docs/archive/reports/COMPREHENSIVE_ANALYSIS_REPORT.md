## üö® **CRITICAL FINDINGS**

### **Major Documentation vs Reality Gaps**

**1. Architecture Mismatch**

- **Planned:** Monorepo with packages/osrs-data/, packages/game-engine/, packages/discord-client/
- **Reality:** Only packages/osrs-data/, packages/game-server/, packages/shared/ exist
- **Main Implementation:** Located in `server-ts/` (not documented in plans)

**2. Technology Stack Drift**

- **Planned:** Phaser 3 + React client, Node.js + Colyseus server
- **Reality:** Godot client, Node.js + Colyseus server (partial match)

**3. Status Contradictions**

- **PHASE_1_DEVELOPMENT_PROMPT.md:** Claims "‚úÖ PHASE 0 FOUNDATION - 100% COMPLETE"
- **ORCHESTRATION_STATUS.md:** Claims "Phase Progress: 25% (1/4 tasks complete)"
- **Reality:** Mixed success with significant achievements but critical issues

**4. Test Status Misrepresentation**

- **Claims:** "ALL OSRS combat formulas implemented and tested (13/13 tests passing)"
- **Reality:** Tests have mixed results, ECS Automation Manager achieving 88.5% success rate
