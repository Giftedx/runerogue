# ðŸŽ¯ NEXT AGENT: START HERE - Phase 1 Enhanced GameRoom

## **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

**Your Mission**: Execute Phase 1 Enhanced GameRoom development as outlined in `NEXT_SESSION_PHASE_1_ENHANCED_GAMEROOM.md`

**Priority**: CRITICAL - This is the foundation for the entire multiplayer system

**Time Allocation**: 60-90 minutes

---

## **QUICK START CHECKLIST**

### **âœ… Step 1: Read the Complete Plan (2 minutes)**

Open and read: `NEXT_SESSION_PHASE_1_ENHANCED_GAMEROOM.md`

**Key sections to focus on**:

- Mission Objectives (lines 7-22)
- Implementation Tasks (lines 54-262)
- Development Checklist (lines 351-397)

### **âœ… Step 2: Validate Current State (3 minutes)**

```bash
# Navigate to server-ts
cd server-ts

# Check TypeScript compilation
npx tsc --noEmit

# Verify current GameRoom exists
ls src/server/rooms/GameRoom.ts
```

**Expected**: GameRoom.ts should exist and TypeScript should compile

### **âœ… Step 3: Begin Task 1 - Enhanced Game Loop (20 minutes)**

**Target File**: `server-ts/src/server/rooms/GameRoom.ts`

**Objective**: Implement 20 TPS game loop with performance monitoring

**Key Changes**:

1. Optimize game loop timing
2. Add system execution order
3. Implement performance metrics
4. Test timing consistency

**Reference**: See lines 59-109 in the phase plan for exact implementation

### **âœ… Step 4: Task 2 - Movement Validation (20 minutes)**

**Objective**: Add OSRS-authentic movement with server validation

**Key Changes**:

1. OSRS movement speed validation (1 tile per 0.6s)
2. Server-side position checking
3. Enhanced MovementSystem integration

**Reference**: See lines 111-157 in the phase plan

### **âœ… Step 5: Task 3 - Connection Management (15 minutes)**

**Objective**: Robust player join/leave with proper cleanup

**Key Changes**:

1. Enhanced player join process with error handling
2. Improved player leave cleanup
3. Broadcasting and game state management

**Reference**: See lines 159-230 in the phase plan

### **âœ… Step 6: Task 4 - Performance Monitoring (10 minutes)**

**Objective**: Add performance metrics for optimization

**Key Changes**:

1. Tick time measurement
2. Performance reporting
3. Memory usage monitoring

**Reference**: See lines 232-263 in the phase plan

### **âœ… Step 7: Integration Testing (15 minutes)**

**Test Scenarios**:

1. 2-player simultaneous connection
2. 4-player load testing
3. State synchronization validation
4. Performance under load

---

## **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS**

### **ðŸŽ¯ Must Achieve**

1. **20 TPS Performance**: Game loop must maintain 20 ticks per second
2. **OSRS Movement**: Authentic movement validation (1 tile per 0.6s)
3. **Multi-Player**: 2-4 players can connect simultaneously
4. **State Sync**: Real-time position/state synchronization
5. **Error Handling**: Robust connection management

### **ðŸš¨ Potential Blockers & Solutions**

**Blocker**: TypeScript compilation errors
**Solution**: Focus on incremental changes, test after each task

**Blocker**: ECS integration issues
**Solution**: Current implementation is working, enhance don't rewrite

**Blocker**: Performance issues
**Solution**: Use performance monitoring to identify bottlenecks

### **âœ… Validation Commands**

```bash
# After each task, test compilation
npx tsc --noEmit

# Test the enhanced GameRoom
npm run dev

# Connect to ws://localhost:2567 to test multiplayer
# Use browser console or test client
```

---

## **CURRENT CODEBASE STATUS**

### **âœ… Foundation Ready**

- **GameRoom.ts**: Located at `server-ts/src/server/rooms/GameRoom.ts`
- **ECS Systems**: 10 systems available and integrated
- **Components**: All OSRS components defined
- **State Sync**: StateSyncSystem working with Colyseus
- **OSRS Data**: All packages tested and working

### **ðŸ“‚ Key Files You'll Modify**

1. **Primary**: `server-ts/src/server/rooms/GameRoom.ts` (Current: 317 lines)
2. **Secondary**: `server-ts/src/server/ecs/systems/MovementSystem.ts` (if needed)
3. **Schema**: `server-ts/src/server/schemas/GameRoomState.ts` (if needed)

### **ðŸ“Š Current Implementation Stats**

- **Players Supported**: 1-4 (basic implementation)
- **ECS Systems**: 10 systems initialized
- **Components**: Full OSRS component set
- **Message Handlers**: 6 handlers (move, attack, prayer, etc.)
- **State Management**: Working but needs optimization

## **PHASE 1 SUCCESS DEFINITION**

After completion, RuneRogue will have:

âœ… **Production-Quality Foundation**: 20 TPS game loop with monitoring  
âœ… **OSRS-Authentic Movement**: Server-validated movement with proper timing  
âœ… **Robust Multiplayer**: 4 players with smooth state synchronization  
âœ… **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics for optimization  
âœ… **Error Handling**: Graceful connection management and recovery

**Result**: Rock-solid foundation ready for Phase 2 auto-combat integration

---

## **EMERGENCY CONTACTS**

**If Stuck**: Refer back to `NEXT_SESSION_PHASE_1_ENHANCED_GAMEROOM.md` for detailed implementation code

**If Errors**: Check `MODULE_RESOLUTION_SUCCESS_REPORT.md` for known issues and solutions

**If Performance Issues**: Focus on incremental changes and use performance monitoring

---

**ðŸŽ¯ REMEMBER**: You are building the foundation that everything else depends on. Take time to do it right - the entire multiplayer experience depends on Phase 1 success.

**ðŸš€ GO TIME**: Start with Task 1 Enhanced Game Loop. You've got this!
