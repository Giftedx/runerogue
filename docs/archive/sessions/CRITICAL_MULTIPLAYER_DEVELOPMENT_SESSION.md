### **Objective: Robust Multiplayer Foundation**

Create a production-quality GameRoom that handles multiple players with ECS integration.

### **Key Implementation Tasks:**

**1. GameRoom Enhancement (30 minutes)**

```typescript
// packages/game-server/src/rooms/GameRoom.ts
export class GameRoom extends Room<GameRoomState> {
  world: World;
  systems: System[];
  gameLoop: NodeJS.Timeout;

  async onCreate(options: any) {
    this.setState(new GameRoomState());
    this.initializeECS();
    this.startGameLoop();
  }

  initializeECS() {
    // Create bitECS world
    // Register all systems (Movement, Combat, Health, etc.)
    // Set up component queries for efficient processing
  }

  onJoin(client: Client, options: any) {
    // Create player entity with Position, Health, Combat components
    // Add to GameRoomState for synchronization
    // Broadcast player join to all clients
    // Initialize player with starter equipment and stats
  }

  onLeave(client: Client) {
    // Remove player entity from ECS world
    // Clean up player state
    // Broadcast player leave event
  }

  gameLoop() {
    // Run ECS systems in correct order
    // Process movement, combat, health changes
    // Handle enemy spawning and AI
    // Update Colyseus state for synchronization
  }
}
```

**Files to Create/Modify:**

- `packages/game-server/src/rooms/GameRoom.ts` - Enhanced multiplayer room
- `packages/game-server/src/schema/GameRoomState.ts` - State management
- `packages/game-server/src/schema/PlayerSchema.ts` - Player synchronization

**2. Movement System Integration (30 minutes)**

```typescript
// Real-time movement with validation
export class MovementSystem extends System {
  update(delta: number) {
    // Process movement input from clients

    // Apply OSRS-authentic movement mechanics
    // Update positions in synchronized state
  }
}

// Server-side input validation
export class InputValidationSystem extends System {
  validateMovement(playerId: string, newPosition: Position) {
    // Check movement speed (OSRS: 1 tile per 0.6s walking)
    // Validate position bounds
    // Prevent teleportation/speed hacking
    // Return validated position or reject
  }
}
```

**Integration Points:**

- Use existing Position component from server-ts/src/server/ecs/components

  update(delta: number) {
    // Spawn enemies around players (not too close, not too far)
    // Scale enemy levels with player levels
    // Manage enemy respawn timers
    // Balance spawn rates for performance (max 20-30 enemies)
  }

  private spawnEnemy(position: Position, level: number) {
    // Create enemy entity with appropriate components
    // Set stats based on level using OSRS formulas
    // Add to spatial tracking for combat system
  }
}
```

    });

    // Handle player join/leave events
    this.room.state.players.onAdd((player, key) => {
      this.renderer.addPlayer(key, player);
    });

    // Handle combat events
    this.room.onMessage("combat", (message) => {
      this.renderer.showCombatEffect(message);
    });
  }

  sendMovementInput(direction: Vector2) {
    this.room.send("move", { direction });
  }
}
```

**2. Real-time Rendering (60 minutes)**

```typescript
// server-ts/src/client/game/GameRenderer.ts
export class GameRenderer {
  private players: Map<string, PlayerRenderer> = new Map();
  private enemies: Map<string, EnemyRenderer> = new Map();

  updateFromServerState(state: GameRoomState) {
    // Update all player positions with interpolation
    // Update enemy positions and health
    // Render damage numbers and XP notifications
    // Update UI elements (health bars, level indicators)
  }

  interpolateMovement(
    entity: Entity,
    serverPos: Position,
    clientPos: Position,
  ) {
    // Smooth interpolation between server updates
    // Client-side prediction for local player

```typescript
// server-ts/src/client/input/InputSystem.ts
export class InputSystem {
  private gameClient: GameClient;
  private predictedPosition: Position;

  handleInput(inputEvent: InputEvent) {
    switch (inputEvent.type) {
      case "movement":
        this.predictMovement(inputEvent.direction);
        this.gameClient.sendMovementInput(inputEvent.direction);
        break;

      case "attack":
        // Client shows attack intention immediately
        // Wait for server validation and damage calculation
        break;
    }
  }

  predictMovement(direction: Vector2) {
    // Predict movement locally for responsiveness
