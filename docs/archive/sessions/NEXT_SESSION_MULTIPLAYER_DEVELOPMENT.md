## 📋 **PHASE 1: MULTIPLAYER SERVER ENHANCEMENT (60-90 minutes)**

### **Step 1: Enhanced GameRoom Implementation**

**Goal:** Create robust multiplayer room with proper player state management

**Key Features to Implement:**

```typescript
// Enhanced GameRoom with ECS integration
export class GameRoom extends Room<GameRoomState> {
  world: World;
  systems: System[];

  async onCreate(options: any) {
    // Initialize ECS world with all systems
    // Set up player spawn logic
    // Configure auto-combat parameters
    // Enable real-time state synchronization
  }

  onJoin(client: Client, options: any) {
    // Create player entity with components
    // Assign starting position and equipment
    // Initialize player progression state
    // Broadcast player join to all clients
  }

  gameLoop() {
    // Run ECS systems in order
    // Update combat, movement, progression
    // Handle enemy spawning and AI
    // Broadcast state changes efficiently
  }
}
```

**Files to Enhance:**

- `packages/game-server/src/rooms/GameRoom.ts`
- `packages/game-server/src/schema/GameRoomState.ts`
- `packages/game-server/src/schema/PlayerSchema.ts`

### **Step 2: Real-time Movement System**

**Goal:** Smooth player movement with client prediction and server validation

**Implementation Requirements:**

```typescript
// Movement system with interpolation
export class MovementSystem extends System {
  update(delta: number) {
    // Validate player input positions
    // Apply movement speed limits (OSRS authentic)
    // Handle collision detection
    // Broadcast position updates with interpolation data
  }
}

// Client-side prediction
export class ClientMovementPredictor {
  // Predict movement locally for responsiveness
  // Reconcile with server authority
  // Handle lag compensation and rollback
}
```

**Performance Targets:**

- Server validation: <5ms per movement
- Client prediction: Immediate response
- Network updates: 20 TPS (50ms intervals)
- Interpolation: Smooth 60fps rendering

### **Step 3: Auto-Combat Integration**

**Goal:** Integrate OSRS-authentic combat calculations with real-time multiplayer

**Combat Features:**

```typescript
export class AutoCombatSystem extends System {
  update(delta: number) {
    // Find nearby enemies for each player
    // Calculate damage using OSRS formulas
    // Apply attack speed timing (4-tick, 5-tick, 6-tick)
    // Update XP using authentic calculations
    // Broadcast combat events and damage numbers
  }
}
```

**Integration Points:**

- Use existing OSRS data from `packages/osrs-data/`
- Apply combat calculations from combat calculator
- Sync with XP progression system
- Visual feedback for damage and XP

---

## 📋 **PHASE 2: CLIENT INTEGRATION (90-120 minutes)**

### **Step 1: Client-Server Connection**

**Goal:** Connect game client to Colyseus multiplayer server

**Client Implementation:**

```typescript
// Main game client
export class GameClient {
  room: Room;

  async connect() {
    this.room = await client.joinOrCreate("game");
    this.setupEventHandlers();
    this.startGameLoop();
  }

  setupEventHandlers() {
    // Handle player join/leave events
    // Process position updates from server
    // Display combat damage and XP notifications
    // Update UI with real-time player stats
  }
}
```

**Key Integration Areas:**

- WebSocket connection management
- State synchronization handling
- Input validation and transmission
- Error handling and reconnection logic

### **Step 2: Real-time Rendering**

**Goal:** Render multiplayer game state with smooth interpolation

**Rendering Requirements:**

```typescript
export class GameRenderer {
  update(delta: number) {
    // Interpolate player positions between server updates
    // Render multiple players simultaneously
    // Display combat effects and damage numbers
    // Show XP notifications and level-ups
    // Update health bars and UI elements
  }
}
```

**Visual Systems:**

- Player avatars with equipment display
- Health bars above players
- Damage numbers with OSRS styling
- XP notifications with skill icons
- Inventory and equipment UI panels

### **Step 3: Input System**

**Goal:** Handle player input with client prediction

**Input Features:**

```typescript
export class InputSystem {
  handleMovement(input: MovementInput) {
    // Predict movement locally
    // Send to server for validation
    // Handle server corrections smoothly
  }

  handleCombat(input: CombatInput) {
    // Request target selection
    // Display attack intentions
    // Wait for server combat resolution
  }
}
```

## 📋 **PHASE 3: GAMEPLAY SYSTEMS (60-90 minutes)**

### **Step 1: Player Progression**

**Goal:** OSRS-authentic XP, levels, and equipment progression

**Progression Features:**

```typescript
export class ProgressionSystem extends System {
  update(delta: number) {
    // Apply XP gain from combat, gathering, etc.
    // Calculate level-ups using OSRS formulas
    // Update player combat stats automatically
    // Handle equipment stat bonuses
    // Save progression state persistently
  }
}
```

**Integration with OSRS Data:**

- Use exact XP tables from packages/osrs-data
- Apply equipment bonuses correctly
- Handle skill-based unlocks
- Validate all calculations against OSRS Wiki

### **Step 2: Inventory and Equipment**

**Goal:** Full inventory management with equipment effects

**System Features:**

```typescript
export class InventorySystem extends System {
  // 28-slot inventory (OSRS standard)
  // Equipment slots (weapon, armor, accessories)
  // Drag-and-drop interface
  // Equipment stat calculations
  // Item stacking and organization
}
```

### **Step 3: Enemy Spawning and AI**

**Goal:** Dynamic enemy spawning with simple AI behavior

**AI Implementation:**

```typescript
export class EnemySpawningSystem extends System {
  update(delta: number) {
    // Spawn enemies around players
    // Scale difficulty with player levels
    // Handle enemy aggression and targeting
    // Manage enemy respawn timers
    // Balance spawn rates for performance
  }
}
```

## 📋 **PHASE 4: TESTING AND OPTIMIZATION (30-60 minutes)**

### **Step 1: Multiplayer Scenario Testing**

**Test Scenarios:**

```bash
# 2-player testing
1. Two players join → move around → fight together
2. Player disconnect/reconnect handling
3. Combat synchronization between players
4. XP and level progression accuracy

# 4-player testing
1. Four players in same area
2. Performance under max load
3. Network latency handling
4. Server tick rate maintenance
```

### **Step 2: Performance Validation**

**Performance Targets:**

```
Client: 60fps sustained with 4 players + 20 enemies
Server: 20 TPS (50ms tick rate) under full load
Network: <100ms latency, efficient delta compression
Memory: Stable usage, no memory leaks
```

### **Step 3: OSRS Authenticity Verification**

**Validation Checklist:**

- [ ] Combat damage matches OSRS Wiki calculations
- [ ] XP gain uses exact OSRS formulas
