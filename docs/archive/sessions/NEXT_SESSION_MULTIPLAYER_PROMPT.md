   - Show damage numbers on successful hits
   - Add combat state indicators (attacking, defending)

2. **Progression Feedback**
   - Real-time XP gain notifications
   - Level-up effects and announcements
   - Skill progression indicators

3. **Wave Management UI**
   - Wave progress indicators
   - Enemy count and remaining time
   - Player status and coordination displays

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Health changes visible in real-time for all entities
- [ ] Damage numbers appear immediately on hits
- [ ] XP and level changes show instantly to all players
- [ ] Wave progress clearly communicated to all players
