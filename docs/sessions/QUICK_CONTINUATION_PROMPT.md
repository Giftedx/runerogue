You are continuing development of RuneRogue, an OSRS-inspired multiplayer roguelike Discord activity.

**CURRENT STATUS**: Combat visual effects have been successfully extracted and are ready for integration.

**JUST COMPLETED**:

- ✅ Extracted 7 authentic OSRS combat assets (5 hitsplats + 2 projectiles) from Wiki
- ✅ Created CombatEffectsManager.js system for handling damage splats and projectiles
- ✅ Built combat-effects-test.html for visual verification
- ✅ Assets copied to Phaser client directory and manifests updated
- ✅ Total assets now: 37 authentic OSRS graphics

**IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES**:

1. **Test the assets**: Open `packages/phaser-client/combat-effects-test.html` to verify all 7 combat assets load correctly
2. **Find main game client**: Locate primary Phaser scenes in `packages/phaser-client/`
3. **Integrate CombatEffectsManager**: Import and initialize in main game scene
4. **Connect to multiplayer**: Link server combat calculations to client visual effects via Colyseus events

**KEY FILES**:

- `packages/phaser-client/combat-effects-test.html` - Test page (start here)
- `packages/phaser-client/assets/osrs/CombatEffectsManager.js` - Effects system
- `packages/phaser-client/assets/osrs/effects/` - Combat assets (7 files)
- `packages/server/src/` - ECS combat systems to enhance

**GOAL**: Get authentic OSRS-style damage splats and projectiles appearing during multiplayer combat, synchronized across all players.

**WORKING DIRECTORY**: `c:\Users\aggis\GitHub\runerogue`

Please continue development by testing the combat assets and integrating them into the multiplayer game client.
