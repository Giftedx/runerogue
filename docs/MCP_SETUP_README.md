# RuneRogue MCP Integration Setup

## 🎯 Overview

This project is now set up with **20+ MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers** providing AI assistance for OSRS-inspired game development, including:

- **Game Development Tools**: OSRS data, memory management, sequential thinking
- **Web & Browser Tools**: Browser automation, web scraping, search capabilities  
- **Development Utilities**: GitHub integration, file management, code analysis
- **AI Enhancement**: Memory persistence, advanced reasoning, multi-step problem solving

## ✅ Current Status

### **COMPLETED SETUP**
- ✅ All 20 MCP repositories cloned successfully
- ✅ Dependencies installed across all repos
- ✅ 10/10 MCP servers verified working
- ✅ Cursor MCP configuration created
- ✅ VS Code workspace configured
- ✅ Environment template provided

### **CORE GAME SYSTEMS STATUS**
- ✅ **Combat System**: 27/27 tests passing - OSRS formulas fully implemented
- ✅ **Prayer System**: 100% tests passing - Complete prayer mechanics
- ✅ **Survivor Wave System**: 100% tests passing - Wave-based gameplay working
- ✅ **Procedural Generation**: 100% tests passing - Map generation working
- ✅ **Economy Integration**: 100% tests passing - API integration complete
- ⚠️ **Multiplayer**: Schema serialization issues in GameRoom tests (non-critical)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Open the Workspace
```bash
# In VS Code Insiders or Cursor
File > Open Workspace from File > mcp-repos.code-workspace
```

### 2. Configure Environment
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp env.template .env

# Edit .env with your API keys:
# - GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
# - TAVILY_API_KEY
# - etc.
```

### 3. Start Development Server
```bash
cd server-ts
npm run dev
```

## 📦 Available MCP Servers

### **Core AI Servers**
- **sequential-thinking**: Advanced multi-step problem solving
- **memory**: Persistent memory across sessions
- **github**: GitHub repository integration
- **tavily**: Web search and research capabilities

### **Game Development**
- **osrs**: OSRS wiki, game data, formulas
- **runerogue-game**: Custom game server integration

### **Development Tools**

- **mcpso**: System operations and file management  
- **open-mcp-client**: MCP client utilities
- **magic-mcp**: Advanced development assistance

## 🎮 Game Development Focus Areas

Based on comprehensive analysis, the **real priorities** are:

### **Priority 1: Multiplayer Stability** 
- Fix remaining Colyseus schema serialization edge cases
- Enhance real-time synchronization

### **Priority 2: Discord Activities Integration**
- Implement Discord Activities for browser play
- Add Discord bot integration for community features

### **Priority 3: Deployment & Infrastructure**
- Set up production deployment pipeline
- Configure monitoring and scaling

### **Priority 4: Enhanced Features**
- ECS architecture refactoring
- Advanced procedural content
- Social features and guilds

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### **Using MCP Servers**
1. **Problem Analysis**: Use `sequential-thinking` for complex game logic
2. **Research**: Use `osrs` and `tavily` for game mechanics research  
3. **Code Development**: Use `github` for repository management
4. **Testing**: Use `browser-tools` for automated testing
5. **Memory**: Use `memory` to persist context across sessions

### **Game Server Development**
```bash
# Run tests
cd server-ts && npm test

# Start development server  
npm run dev

# Check game status
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### **Client Development**
```bash
# Meta UI development
cd server-ts/client/meta-ui
npm run dev

# Godot client (if available)
cd server-ts/client/godot
# Open in Godot editor
```
