# üìä DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY UPDATE

**From:** Master Orchestrator  
**To:** All Active Agents  
**Re:** Competitive Intelligence & Strategic Focus  

---

## üéØ KEY INSIGHT

We've analyzed [Giftedx/runerogue](https://github.com/Giftedx/runerogue) - another team building an OSRS game. They're attempting a **full OSRS recreation** with 9 concurrent modules and struggling with complexity (18 draft PRs, all WIP).

**Our Advantage:** We're building **OSRS √ó Vampire Survivors on Discord** - a focused, unique product.

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT

1. **Focused Scope** - Vampire Survivors gameplay, not full OSRS
2. **Clear Phases** - Sequential, not 9 parallel modules  
3. **Platform Innovation** - Discord-native, not another client
4. **Specialized Agents** - Clear ownership and boundaries
5. **New Multiplayer Robustness:** Seamless reconnection, real-time performance validation, and authentic OSRS movement in the browser client.

---

## üìù MINOR ADJUSTMENTS

### **For All Agents:**

1. **Use Feature Branches**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b agent/osrs-data/combat-formulas
   git checkout -b agent/backend-infra/colyseus-setup
   ```

2. **Track TODOs Consistently**
   ```typescript
   // TODO(osrs-data): Implement prayer bonus calculations
   // TODO(backend-infra): Add rate limiting to rooms
   ```

3. **Create Draft PRs Early**
   - Push work-in-progress for visibility
   - Mark as "Draft" until ready
   - Helps track progress

- **New:** All multiplayer features must support reconnection (30s grace), in-game performance monitoring, and OSRS-authentic click-to-move for client polish.

---

## üö´ WHAT NOT TO DO

### **Scope Creep Warnings:**
- ‚ùå NO Grand Exchange implementation (Phase 0-1)
- ‚ùå NO PvP systems (not our focus)
- ‚ùå NO Complex skill trees (keep it simple)
- ‚ùå NO Procedural maps (fixed arenas work fine)

### **Stay Focused On:**
- ‚úÖ Combat that feels like OSRS
- ‚úÖ Waves like Vampire Survivors
- ‚úÖ Quick Discord sessions
- ‚úÖ Addictive progression loop

---

## üéÆ OUR UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION

**"5-minute OSRS combat sessions on Discord"**

While others build complex MMOs, we're building the perfect game for:
- Discord communities during voice chats
- OSRS fans on work breaks
- Casual sessions with deep mechanics

---

## üí° STRATEGIC REMINDERS

### **agent/osrs-data:**
- Focus on combat mechanics, not full skill system
- 5 enemies is enough for Phase 0
- Accuracy > Completeness

### **agent/backend-infra:**
- 4-player rooms perfect for Discord groups
- Performance > Features
- Simple > Complex

### **Future Phases:**
- Phase 1: Core game loop (movement, combat, waves)
- Phase 2: Basic progression (levels, unlocks)
- Phase 3: Discord integration polish
- Phase 4+: Community feedback driven

---

## üìà SUCCESS METRICS THAT MATTER

**Forget:**
- Feature count
- System complexity
- Full OSRS compliance

**Focus:**
- Time to first playable build
- Fun factor in 5 minutes
- Discord integration smoothness
- Combat feel accuracy

---

## üèÅ BOTTOM LINE

The other RuneRogue proves market interest but also shows the danger of scope creep. We win by doing ONE thing well: **making OSRS combat addictive in Vampire Survivors format on Discord**.

**Every decision should ask:** Does this make our core loop more fun?

**Keep building, stay focused, ship fast!**
