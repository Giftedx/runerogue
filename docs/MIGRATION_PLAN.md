## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas

1. **Economy System Integration**: The integration between TypeScript and Python components for the economy system is complex and critical.
   - **Mitigation**: Start with a simple API, create extensive test cases, implement gradually

2. **Database Migration**: Moving from the current database setup to a more integrated approach is risky.
   - **Mitigation**: Create comprehensive backup strategy, test migrations thoroughly, plan for rollback

3. **Client Compatibility**: Ensuring all client applications work with the new architecture.
   - **Mitigation**: Maintain API compatibility, version endpoints, create client migration guides

### Contingency Plans

1. **Economy Integration Fallback**: If direct integration proves too complex, implement a message queue-based approach as a fallback.

2. **Phased Database Migration**: If full database consolidation is too risky, implement read-only access to legacy databases while writing to new databases.

3. **Legacy System Maintenance**: If migration timelines extend, establish a maintenance mode for legacy systems to ensure they remain functional.

## Timeline and Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Deliverables |
|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Documentation Complete | Week 2 | Updated architecture documents |
| Economy API Operational | Week 6 | Working API integration |
| Client Integration Complete | Week 10 | Functional clients with all features |
| Legacy Migration Plan | Week 14 | Clear path for legacy components |
| Testing Complete | Week 16 | Comprehensive test coverage |
| Project Complete | Week 18 | Final architecture operational |

## Success Criteria

The migration will be considered successful when:

1. The TypeScript game server is the primary backend component
2. Economy system is fully integrated with the game server
3. All client applications function with the new architecture
4. Test coverage exceeds 80% across all components
5. Documentation accurately reflects the implemented architecture
6. Legacy components are either migrated or have clear deprecation plans

## Conclusion

This migration plan provides a structured approach to evolving the RuneRogue architecture from its original conception to the current implementation. By following this plan, the team can address technical debt, improve system integration, and establish a solid foundation for future development.
