# SPEC-1: RuneRogue Self-Building Process Specification

## Overview

SPEC-1 defines the self-building process for RuneRogue, enabling the application to autonomously monitor, analyze, improve, and deploy its own enhancements while maintaining reliability and security.

## Core Principles

1. **Safety First**: All autonomous changes must pass comprehensive validation
2. **Gradual Evolution**: Incremental improvements over dramatic changes
3. **Observability**: Every change must be measurable and reversible
4. **Human Oversight**: Critical decisions require human approval
5. **Continuous Learning**: System improves based on performance data

## Implementation Guidelines

### Performance Metrics
- Response time (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rates by endpoint
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk)
- Throughput and concurrent users
- External service latency

### Quality Metrics
- Code coverage percentage
- Linting violations
- Security vulnerability count
- Technical debt score
- Test success rate

### Safety Mechanisms
- Automated rollback on performance regression
- Circuit breakers for new features
- Blue-green deployment for major changes
- Canary releases for risky improvements
- Human approval gates for critical changes

### Approval Workflows
- **Low Risk**: Automatic deployment (minor config, documentation)
- **Medium Risk**: Automated testing + staging validation
- **High Risk**: Human review required
- **Critical Risk**: Multi-person approval required

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
SELF_BUILD_ENABLED=true
SELF_BUILD_RISK_THRESHOLD=medium
SELF_BUILD_APPROVAL_REQUIRED=high
METRICS_COLLECTION_INTERVAL=60
IMPROVEMENT_SUGGESTION_FREQUENCY=weekly
```

### Monitoring Endpoints
- `/metrics` - Prometheus-style metrics
- `/health/detailed` - Comprehensive health check
- `/health/score` - Current health score and component breakdown
- `/health/trends` - Health trends over time
- `/monitoring/alerts` - Current monitoring alerts
- `/performance/baseline` - Performance baseline data
- `/improvements/suggestions` - Current improvement suggestions
- `/improvements/history` - Past improvements and results

## Security Considerations

1. **Code Changes**: All automated code changes must pass security scans
2. **Data Access**: Monitoring does not access sensitive user data
3. **External Communication**: No external services without explicit approval
4. **Privilege Escalation**: Self-improvements cannot modify security settings
5. **Audit Trail**: All changes logged for compliance and debugging

## Risk Management

### Risk Categories
- **Infrastructure**: Changes to CI/CD, deployment, configuration
- **Application**: Code changes, feature additions, bug fixes
- **Data**: Database schema, data processing, storage changes
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, encryption changes
- **Performance**: Optimization, caching, resource allocation

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- Staging environment validation
- Performance regression testing
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Gradual rollout mechanisms

## Success Metrics

### Short Term (M0-M1)
- 99.9% CI/CD pipeline reliability
- <10% false positive rate in improvement detection
- 100% coverage of critical performance metrics
- <5 minute mean time to detect performance issues

### Medium Term (M2-M3)
- 70% of suggestions result in measurable improvements
- 50% reduction in manual maintenance tasks
- 99.95% uptime during autonomous improvements
- <1 hour mean time to resolution for issues

### Long Term (M4+)
- 30% improvement in overall system performance
- 80% reduction in human intervention required
- 99.99% uptime with autonomous improvements
- Self-generated features meet user satisfaction >85%

## Governance

### Review Schedule
- Weekly: Performance metrics and improvement suggestions
- Monthly: Risk assessment and safety mechanism effectiveness
- Quarterly: Milestone progress and strategy adjustment
- Annually: Complete specification review and updates

### Escalation Paths
1. Automated system alerts → On-call engineer
2. Medium risk changes → Lead developer approval
3. High risk changes → Architecture team review
4. Critical changes → CTO approval required
