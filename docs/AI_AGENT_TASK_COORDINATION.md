## Implementation Achievements

### ‚úÖ Combat Formula Rectification (COMPLETED)
**Lead Architect Agent - Successfully Delivered**

**Major Changes Implemented**:
1. **‚úÖ Fixed performAttack method** - Now uses OSRS-accurate hit chance and damage calculations
2. **‚úÖ Implemented calculateHitChance** - Uses proper attack roll vs defense roll formula
3. **‚úÖ Implemented calculateMaxHit** - Uses OSRS max hit formula: `floor(1.3 + (effective_strength * (strength_bonus + 64)) / 640)`
4. **‚úÖ Added getEffectiveStrengthLevel** - Applies combat style bonuses correctly
5. **‚úÖ Updated getEffectiveAttackLevel** - Added combat style parameter support
6. **‚úÖ Maintained test compatibility** - All existing tests pass with new implementations

**OSRS Formula Accuracy**:
- ‚úÖ Hit chance: Proper attack roll vs defense roll implementation
- ‚úÖ Max hit: Exact OSRS formula with effective strength and equipment bonuses
- ‚úÖ Combat styles: Accurate (+3 attack), Aggressive (+3 strength), Defensive (+3 defense), Controlled (+1 all)
- ‚úÖ Equipment bonuses: Attack and defense bonuses properly applied
- ‚úÖ Random damage: 0 to maxHit damage roll (OSRS standard)
