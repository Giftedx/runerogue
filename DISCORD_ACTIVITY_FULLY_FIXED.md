# Discord Activity - All Issues Resolved

## Status: ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL

**Date**: June 23, 2025  
**Time**: 05:45 UTC

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ CORS Errors - FIXED

**Issue**: Cross-Origin Request Blocked due to missing CORS headers
**Solution**:

- Updated CORS configuration in `packages/game-server/src/index.ts`
- Added support for ports 3000 and 3001
- Added Discord domains to allowed origins
- Fixed preflight OPTIONS handling

**Verification**: Server logs show successful connections with no CORS errors

### 2. ✅ Colyseus Schema Metadata Errors - FIXED

**Issue**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'Symbol(Symbol.metadata)')`
**Solution**:

- Enhanced `schemaCompat.ts` utility with recursive metadata fixing
- Applied hierarchical fixes to all schema classes
- Fixed ArraySchema and MapSchema metadata compatibility
- Applied fixes in GameRoomState, PlayerSchema, and all nested schemas

**Verification**: Server logs show no schema metadata errors, state synchronization working

### 3. ✅ React Component Null State Errors - FIXED

**Issue**: `can't convert undefined to object` in Minimap component
**Solution**:

- Updated GameRoomProvider context to handle null state gracefully
- Modified Minimap component to check for null/undefined state
- Added loading states for components when room state is not ready
- Changed MapSchema iteration from `Object.values()` to `Array.from().values()`

**Verification**: React components render without errors, graceful loading states

### 4. ✅ WebSocket Connection Issues - FIXED

**Issue**: Connection interrupted during page load, 503 errors
**Solution**:

- Ensured HTTPS certificates are properly configured
- Verified both servers start in correct order
- Fixed WebSocket transport configuration
- Added proper connection retry logic

**Verification**: WSS connection established successfully, state sync working

## Current Server Status

### Game Server (Port 2567)

```
🎮 Game Server: wss://localhost:2567
🌐 HTTP API: https://localhost:2567
📊 Monitor: https://localhost:2567/colyseus
```

**Status**: ✅ Running with HTTPS/WSS
**Features Working**:

- ✅ Player join/leave
- ✅ State synchronization
- ✅ Enemy spawning (3 initial goblins)
- ✅ AI system (continuous updates)
- ✅ Combat system ready
- ✅ WebSocket transport
- ✅ Schema serialization

### Client Server (Port 3000)

```
➜  Local:   https://localhost:3000/
```

**Status**: ✅ Running with HTTPS
**Features Working**:

- ✅ Discord Activity framework
- ✅ React + Phaser integration
- ✅ Colyseus client connection
- ✅ State synchronization
- ✅ UI components with null-safe rendering
- ✅ Game scene initialization

## Test Results

### Connection Test (test-wss-connection.js)

```
✅ HTTPS/WSS connection successful!
📊 Room state keys: [ 'players', 'enemies', 'waveNumber', 'enemiesKilled' ]
🔄 Room state changed (continuous updates working)
```

### Server Logs

```
✅ Client connected (zKOxzylVX joined!)
✅ Enemy spawning working (3 initial enemies spawned)
✅ AI system running (continuous AI updates)
✅ No schema metadata errors
✅ No CORS errors
```

## Browser Test Status

### Components Loading Successfully

- ✅ DiscordActivityProvider - Working (demo mode outside Discord)
- ✅ GameRoomProvider - Connected to Colyseus server
- ✅ Minimap - Null-safe rendering with loading state
- ✅ All UI components loading without errors
- ✅ Phaser game scene initializing
- ✅ WebSocket connection established

### Remaining Minor Issues

- ⚠️ AudioContext warning (expected - needs user gesture)
- ⚠️ Some missing source maps (development only)
- ⚠️ h1-check.js undefined (Discord SDK - expected outside Discord)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Ready for Testing)

1. **✅ COMPLETE**: Test in browser at `https://localhost:3000`
2. **✅ COMPLETE**: Verify client-server communication
3. **✅ COMPLETE**: Confirm state synchronization

### Discord Testing (Next Phase)

1. **Test Discord Activity**: Open Discord and test the activity in a voice channel
2. **Verify OAuth Flow**: Ensure Discord authentication works properly
3. **Test Multiplayer**: Have multiple users join the same game room
4. **End-to-end Testing**: Complete gameplay test with all features
