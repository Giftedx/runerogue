### ✅ Project Structure

- **Organized Scripts**: Separated by functionality
- **Asset Directories**: Ready for sprites, audio, fonts
- **Build System**: Web export configuration and build script
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive renderer documentation

## Current State

The renderer is now functional with:

1. A working main menu that transitions to the game
2. Procedurally generated world with different terrain types
3. Player character that can move around the world
4. Dynamic fog of war that reveals as you explore
5. Complete HUD with health, stats, and chat
6. Visual effects system ready for particles
7. Web-optimized rendering pipeline

## How to Test

1. Install Godot 4.3+
2. Open the project in Godot from `server-ts/client/godot/`
3. Press F5 to run
4. Click "Play Game" to start
5. Use arrow keys to move around

## Next Steps for Full Production

1. **Add Sprite Assets**: Replace colored rectangles with actual sprites
2. **Implement Networking**: Connect to the game server
3. **Add Sound Effects**: Implement audio system
4. **Enhance Combat**: Add enemies and combat mechanics
5. **Inventory System**: Implement item management
6. **Save/Load**: Add game persistence
7. **Mobile Support**: Add touch controls

The renderer foundation is complete and ready for further development!
