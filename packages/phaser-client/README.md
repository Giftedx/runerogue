# packages/phaser-client

**Status: Legacy / Experimental**

This package contains a collection of standalone HTML and JavaScript files that were used for early versions, experiments, and proofs-of-concept for the RuneRogue client.

## Contents

- Various `.html` and `.js` files representing different stages of client development.
- A simple `serve.js` script to run a local web server for these files.

## Recommendation

This package is **deprecated and considered legacy**. It does not represent the current state of the client application.

The canonical, active client is the Vite + React + Phaser project located in the `/client` directory at the root of the monorepo.

The contents of this package are pending review and will likely be moved to an `archive` directory or deleted. Do not use for any new development.
