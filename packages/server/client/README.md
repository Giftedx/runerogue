# Client-Side Architecture

This directory contains the client-side applications for the RuneRogue project. It is composed of two main sub-projects:

- **`godot/`**: This directory houses the Godot Engine project, which is intended for the primary game client. It handles the core game logic, rendering, and user interaction.

- **`meta-ui/`**: This directory contains a web-based user interface, likely built with a framework like React or Vue (further details within its own README). It serves as a meta-interface for features such as account management, social interactions, or out-of-game configurations.

Further documentation for each client can be found in their respective subdirectories.
