## Description

**HOSTED TAVILY EXPERT MCP INTEGRATION TEST**: Validate the newly configured hosted Tavily Expert MCP server integration with GitHub Copilot Agents. This test will verify that the hosted service at `https://tavily.api.tadata.com/mcp/tavily/pan-melon-carabao-g8m9ge` is properly accessible and functional.

## Research Objectives

Use the **Tavily Expert MCP server** to research and analyze:

1. **Current OSRS Economy Landscape**

   - Latest Grand Exchange market trends (June 2025)
   - High-value item price movements
   - Player trading behavior patterns

2. **Competing OSRS Economy Tools**

   - Other Grand Exchange tracking APIs and services
   - Feature comparison with our RuneRogue project
   - Market positioning opportunities

3. **Recent Game Updates Impact**
   - OSRS updates from Q2 2025
   - Economic impacts of recent changes
   - New items or mechanics affecting the economy

## Expected MCP Behavior

- ✅ Tavily Expert MCP server should be automatically detected
- ✅ No API key management required (hosted service)
- ✅ Enhanced search capabilities optimized for expert research
- ✅ Works best with Claude Sonnet 3.7 model
- ✅ Provides comprehensive, AI-enhanced search results

## Success Criteria

- [ ] **MCP Server Connection**: Hosted Tavily Expert MCP server connects successfully
- [ ] **Search Functionality**: Performs intelligent web searches for OSRS economy data
- [ ] **Result Quality**: Returns relevant, recent, and comprehensive information
- [ ] **Expert Enhancement**: Demonstrates enhanced capabilities beyond basic search
- [ ] **Performance**: Responds quickly without local dependencies
- [ ] **Integration**: Works seamlessly with GitHub Copilot Agents

## Comparison Points

Compare results with our local NPX-based Tavily MCP setup:

- **Speed**: Hosted vs local execution performance
- **Quality**: Expert-enhanced vs standard search results
- **Reliability**: Network dependency vs local execution
- **Features**: Available tools and capabilities
- **Ease of Use**: Setup complexity and maintenance

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Hosted Tavily Expert MCP server responds to research requests
- [ ] Gathers actionable intelligence about OSRS economy landscape
- [ ] Identifies at least 3 competing services with feature analysis
- [ ] Documents recent game updates and their economic impacts
- [ ] Provides clear, well-structured research findings
- [ ] Demonstrates value over basic web search approaches

## Configuration Verification

Ensure the following setup is correct:

- ✅ Configuration file: `~/.github/copilot/mcp.json`
- ✅ Server URL: `https://tavily.api.tadata.com/mcp/tavily/pan-melon-carabao-g8m9ge`
- ✅ GitHub Copilot restarted after configuration
- ✅ Using Claude Sonnet 3.7 for optimal results

## Troubleshooting Checklist

If the integration fails:

- [ ] Verify `~/.github/copilot/mcp.json` file exists and is properly formatted
- [ ] Confirm GitHub Copilot has been restarted completely
- [ ] Check network connectivity to hosted service
- [ ] Ensure using Claude Sonnet 3.7 model
- [ ] Compare with local NPX-based setup for reference

## Follow-up Actions

Based on test results:

- [ ] Document hosted service capabilities and limitations
- [ ] Create usage guidelines for team members
- [ ] Determine optimal use cases for hosted vs local approach
- [ ] Update team workflows to leverage expert MCP capabilities
- [ ] Consider long-term strategy for MCP server management
