# RuneRogue Project Overview

## What is RuneRogue?

RuneRogue is an OSRS-inspired multiplayer roguelike survival game designed as a Discord activity. It combines the authentic combat mechanics of Old School RuneScape with the fast-paced gameplay patterns of Vampire Survivors, creating a unique multiplayer experience.

## Core Concept

- **Genre**: Multiplayer roguelike survival with OSRS mechanics
- **Platform**: Discord Activity (web-based)
- **Players**: 2-4 players per room
- **Gameplay**: Survive waves of enemies using authentic OSRS combat, prayer, and skill systems
- **Progression**: OSRS-style XP and levels with equipment upgrades

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- **Phaser 3** - Game rendering engine
- **React** - UI components and menus
- **Vite** - Build tool and development server

### Backend

- **Node.js + TypeScript** - Server runtime
- **Colyseus** - Real-time multiplayer framework
- **Express** - REST API server
- **bitECS** - Entity Component System architecture

### Data & Storage

- **Prisma ORM** - Database abstraction

- **OSRS Wiki API** - Authentic game data

### Infrastructure

- **Turborepo** - Monorepo management
- **pnpm** - Package management
- **Jest** - Testing framework
- **Docker** - Containerization

- Enemy spawning and AI
- Basic UI with health/prayer bars
- Discord activity integration

### ðŸš€ Phase 2: Core Gameplay (PLANNED)

- Full OSRS skill system
- Equipment and inventory
- Advanced prayer system
- Player progression and saves

### ðŸ“ˆ Phase 3: Polish & Launch (PLANNED)

- Performance optimization

- Advanced enemy types
- Social features and leaderboards
- Tutorial and onboarding
- Public Discord activity release

## Key Principles

### OSRS Authenticity

- **Exact Formulas**: All calculations must match OSRS Wiki specifications
- **Authentic Mechanics**: Combat, prayer, and skill systems work exactly like OSRS
- **Verified Data**: Use real OSRS data from Wiki API, not approximations
- **Player Expectations**: OSRS players should feel at home

### Multiplayer Performance

- **60fps Target**: Smooth gameplay with 4 players and 20+ enemies
- **Server Authority**: All game state validated on server to prevent cheating
- **Low Latency**: Client prediction and smooth interpolation
- **Scalable Architecture**: Clean ECS design for future features

### Code Quality

- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript with comprehensive error handling
- **Test Coverage**: >90% coverage for all game logic
- **Documentation**: JSDoc comments and architectural documentation

## Success Metrics

### Technical

- 60fps sustained with 4 players + 20 enemies
- <100ms server response time
- > 90% test coverage on game systems
- Zero production TypeScript errors

### Gameplay

- Combat feels authentic to OSRS players
- Smooth multiplayer synchronization
- Intuitive Discord activity integration

### Quality

- No game-breaking bugs
- Graceful error handling and recovery
- Clear user feedback for all actions
- Professional polish and presentation

## Current Status

- **OSRS Data Pipeline**: âœ… Complete - All formulas implemented and tested
- **Multiplayer Server**: âœ… Complete - Colyseus rooms operational
- **ECS Architecture**: âœ… Complete - 14 components, 10 systems
- **API Endpoints**: âœ… Complete - Full OSRS data access
- **Client Integration**: ðŸ”„ In Progress - Connecting Phaser to Colyseus
- **Combat Visualization**: ðŸ”„ In Progress - Rendering calculated damage
- **UI Development**: ðŸ”„ In Progress - Health bars and game interface

## Getting Started

1. **Clone Repository**: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. **Install Dependencies**: `pnpm install`
3. **Start Development**: `pnpm dev`
4. **Run Tests**: `pnpm test`
5. **View Documentation**: Check `/docs` folder

## Resources
