# Prompt Template

This is the standard template for all prompt files in the RuneRogue project. Each prompt file should follow this format:

1. Start with YAML frontmatter containing `mode: agent`
2. Include a descriptive title as H1
3. Provide clear, specific instructions for the AI agent
4. Include relevant context and constraints
5. Use proper markdown formatting throughout

When creating new prompt files:

- Name them with format: `{number}.{descriptive-name}.prompt.md`
- Keep content focused on specific development areas
- Reference other prompts when appropriate
- Update regularly as the project evolves
