# Cursor IDE Configuration

Create proper Cursor rules and prompt files for the RuneRogue project to ensure consistent AI assistance across development.

## Primary Configuration File

Create `.cursorrules` in the project root with the following content:

```markdown
# RuneRogue Development Rules

You are an expert TypeScript developer working on RuneRogue, an OSRS-inspired multiplayer roguelike game. Follow these guidelines:

## Code Standards
- Use TypeScript with strict type checking
- Follow OSRS authenticity - all game mechanics must match OSRS Wiki exactly
- Implement comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks
- Add JSDoc comments for all public APIs
- Use modern ES6+ features and async/await patterns
- Maintain 60fps performance with multiplayer optimization

## Architecture
- Use bitECS for game entity component system
- Colyseus for multiplayer server architecture
- Server-authoritative design - validate all client inputs
- Use Turborepo monorepo structure with pnpm
- Follow clean architecture principles

## Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Test OSRS calculations against Wiki data
- Include performance tests for multiplayer scenarios
- Maintain >90% test coverage for game systems

## Project Context
- Phase 1: Building playable multiplayer prototype
- Current status: OSRS data pipeline complete, need client-server integration
- Technology: TypeScript, Phaser 3, Colyseus, bitECS, PostgreSQL
- Focus: Authentic OSRS mechanics with modern multiplayer experience

## File Structure
```
packages/
├── osrs-data/     # OSRS formulas and data (COMPLETE)
├── game-server/   # Colyseus multiplayer server
└── shared/        # Shared types and utilities
server-ts/         # Main game implementation
client/            # React UI components
```

When suggesting code:
1. Always include proper TypeScript types
2. Add error handling and validation
3. Include relevant unit tests
4. Consider multiplayer implications
5. Reference OSRS Wiki for game mechanics
6. Optimize for performance (60fps target)
```

## Environment Configuration

Update `.cursor/environment.json`:

```json
{
  "agentCanUpdateSnapshot": true,
  "rules": [
    "Always provide complete, production-ready code",
    "Use authentic OSRS mechanics from Wiki data",
    "Implement proper multiplayer validation",
    "Include comprehensive error handling",
    "Add JSDoc documentation",
    "Write unit tests for game logic",
    "Optimize for 60fps performance"
  ],
  "context": {
    "project": "RuneRogue - OSRS-inspired multiplayer roguelike",
    "phase": "Phase 1 - Multiplayer prototype development", 
    "technology": "TypeScript, Colyseus, bitECS, Phaser 3",
    "currentFocus": "Client-server integration and combat visualization"
  }
}
```

## Prompt File Organization

Create specialized prompt files in `.github/prompts/` for different development areas:

### Core Development (`development.md`)
- Project overview and current status
- Technology stack and architecture
- Development guidelines and standards
- Current priorities and objectives

### OSRS Mechanics (`osrs-mechanics.md`) 
- Authentic OSRS combat formulas
- Skill system implementation
- Prayer and equipment mechanics
- Data validation requirements

### Multiplayer Architecture (`multiplayer.md`)
- Colyseus server patterns
- Client-server synchronization
- State management with schemas
- Network optimization techniques

### TypeScript Standards (`typescript.md`)
- Type safety best practices
- Error handling patterns
- Performance optimization
- Component architecture (bitECS)

### Testing Guidelines (`testing.md`)
- Unit test standards
- Integration test patterns
- Performance testing
- OSRS data validation

## MCP Server Integration

Configure MCP servers in `.cursor/mcp.json` for enhanced development capabilities:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "osrs": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["dist/mcp-server.js"],
      "cwd": "server-ts"
    },
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-git"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Creating .cursorrules**: Place in project root for global AI assistance rules
2. **GitHub Prompts**: Reference with `@development.md` or `@osrs-mechanics.md` in Cursor chat
3. **Environment Config**: Cursor will automatically apply these settings
4. **MCP Tools**: Access OSRS data and project context through MCP servers

## Best Practices

### When to Use Each Prompt File

- **@development.md**: For general coding tasks and project setup
- **@osrs-mechanics.md**: When implementing combat, skills, or game mechanics  
- **@multiplayer.md**: For networking, synchronization, and server code
- **@typescript.md**: For type safety, performance, and architecture questions
- **@testing.md**: When writing tests or debugging issues

### Effective Prompting

```
# Good prompt examples:

"Using @osrs-mechanics.md, implement the prayer drain system for active prayers"

"Following @multiplayer.md guidelines, create a Colyseus room for combat simulation"

"Apply @typescript.md patterns to create type-safe ECS components for player stats"

"Using @testing.md standards, write unit tests for the damage calculation system"
```

### Project-Specific Context

Always include relevant context when asking for help:

- Current phase (Phase 1 - Multiplayer prototype)
- Technology being used (TypeScript, Colyseus, bitECS)
- OSRS authenticity requirements
- Performance targets (60fps multiplayer)
- Testing expectations (>90% coverage)

This configuration ensures Cursor provides consistent, high-quality assistance tailored to the RuneRogue project's specific needs and standards.
