# RuneRogue Development Prompt

## Project Context

**RuneRogue** is an OSRS-inspired roguelike survival game designed as a Discord activity. It combines Old School RuneScape mechanics with Vampire Survivors gameplay patterns, featuring multiplayer Discord integration and persistent OSRS-style progression.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: TypeScript + Phaser 3 + React + Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js + TypeScript + Colyseus + Express
- **Data Layer**: OSRS Wiki integration via MCP tools
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
- **Testing**: Jest with comprehensive validation
- **Architecture**: Turborepo monorepo with pnpm
- **Real-time**: WebSocket-based multiplayer via Colyseus

## Current Project Status

### âœ… Phase 0 Foundation (COMPLETE)

- **OSRS Data Pipeline**: All combat formulas implemented and tested (13/13 tests passing)
- **API Server**: Deployed and running on port 3001 with full JSON API
- **Game Server Infrastructure**: Colyseus server operational on port 2567
- **ECS Architecture**: bitECS implementation with 14 components and 10 systems
- **Combat System**: Authentic OSRS mechanics with validated calculations
- **Prayer System**: All OSRS prayers implemented (335k+ ops/sec performance)
- **Quality Assurance**: All unit tests passing, no TypeScript errors

### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 1 Objectives (CURRENT)

Create a **playable multiplayer prototype** where 2-4 players can join a room, move around, and engage in auto-combat with spawned enemies using authentic OSRS mechanics.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

1. **Production-Ready Code**: Always provide complete, error-handled implementations
2. **TypeScript Best Practices**: Proper typing, avoid `any`, use generics appropriately
3. **OSRS Authenticity**: All game mechanics must match OSRS Wiki specifications exactly
4. **Performance First**: Optimize for 60fps gameplay with multiple players
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests for all business logic, integration tests for APIs

### Architecture Patterns

1. **ECS Architecture**: Use bitECS for all game entities and systems
2. **Event-Driven**: Implement proper event handling for multiplayer synchronization
3. **State Management**: Colyseus schema for authoritative server state
4. **Modular Design**: Clear separation between game logic, rendering, and networking

### OSRS Integration Requirements

1. **Combat Formulas**: Use exact OSRS calculations (already implemented in `packages/osrs-data/`)
2. **Stat Progression**: Follow OSRS XP tables and skill mechanics
3. **Prayer System**: Use authentic prayer effects and drain rates
4. **Item Stats**: Match OSRS Wiki item statistics exactly
5. **Enemy Behavior**: Implement OSRS-accurate NPC mechanics

### Error Handling & Logging

1. **Graceful Degradation**: Handle network failures and reconnections
2. **Comprehensive Logging**: Use Winston for structured logging
3. **Error Recovery**: Implement retry mechanisms for critical operations
4. **User Feedback**: Clear error messages for players

### Testing Requirements

1. **Unit Tests**: All utility functions and game mechanics
2. **Integration Tests**: API endpoints and database operations
3. **Performance Tests**: Ensure 60fps with 4 players and 20+ enemies
4. **OSRS Validation**: Compare calculations against OSRS Wiki data

## File Structure Context

```

## Current Priority Tasks

### Immediate (Phase 1)

1. **Client-Server Integration**: Connect Phaser client to Colyseus server
2. **Player Movement**: Implement smooth multiplayer movement with prediction
3. **Combat Visualization**: Render combat calculations from OSRS data API
4. **Enemy Spawning**: Create dynamic enemy generation system
5. **UI Development**: Health bars, combat stats, prayer interface

### Code Examples Required

When implementing new features, always include:

1. **TypeScript Interfaces**: Proper type definitions
2. **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks with meaningful errors
3. **JSDoc Comments**: Complete API documentation
4. **Unit Tests**: Jest tests with good coverage
5. **Performance Considerations**: Optimization notes

## MCP Tool Integration

The project has access to these MCP tools for development:

- **OSRS Data**: For authentic game mechanics and stats
- **GitHub**: For repository management and issue tracking
- **Browser Tools**: For testing and debugging
- **Sequential Thinking**: For complex problem-solving
- **Memory**: For maintaining context across sessions

## Success Criteria

A successful implementation should:

1. **Run Smoothly**: 60fps with 4 players and multiple enemies
2. **Feel Authentic**: OSRS-like combat and progression
3. **Scale Well**: Clean architecture for future features
4. **Test Coverage**: >90% test coverage for game logic
5. **Documentation**: Complete API and architecture docs

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Hardcoded Values**: Use OSRS data API for all game constants
2. **Client Authority**: Keep authoritative state on server
3. **Performance Issues**: Profile and optimize frequently
4. **Type Safety**: Don't use `any` types
5. **Testing Gaps**: Test edge cases and error conditions

Remember: This is a multiplayer game that needs to feel responsive and fair to all players while maintaining authentic OSRS mechanics.
