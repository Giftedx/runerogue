## Task 2: [agent/osrs-data] OSRS Wiki Data Pipeline Foundation

**Title:** `[AGENT TASK] [agent/osrs-data] Create OSRS Wiki Data Pipeline - Combat & Initial Enemies`

**Priority:** CRITICAL - All other agents depend on this data foundation

**Agent:** agent/osrs-data (The Lorekeeper)

**Description:**
Create the foundational OSRS Wiki data pipeline that serves as the canonical source of truth for all game mechanics.

**Specific Requirements:**

1. **Combat Formulas Implementation:**
   - Max Hit formula (Strength bonus, Prayer effects, Equipment bonuses)
   - Accuracy formula (Attack vs Defence calculations) 
   - Attack speed calculations for different weapon types

2. **Initial Enemy Data (5 enemies):**
   - Goblin (level 2)
   - Cow (level 2)
   - Chicken (level 1) 
   - Giant Rat (level 1)
   - Zombie (level 13)

3. **Player Base Stats:**
   - Base combat stats (Attack: 1, Strength: 1, Defence: 1, Hitpoints: 10)
   - Combat level calculation
   - Base equipment stats (no equipment = 0 bonuses)

4. **Data API Structure:**
   - `/api/combat/max-hit` - Calculate max hit for given stats
   - `/api/combat/accuracy` - Calculate hit probability  
   - `/api/enemies/{id}` - Get enemy stats
   - `/api/formulas/validate` - Validate calculations against Wiki

**Technical Implementation:**
- Package: `packages/osrs-data/`
- Use OSRS MCP tools for wiki access
- Node.js/TypeScript with Jest testing
- JSON data files stored in `packages/osrs-data/data/`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Combat calculations match OSRS Wiki formulas exactly
- [ ] All 5 enemy stat blocks complete and accurate
- [ ] JSON API endpoints return structured data
- [ ] Unit tests validate calculations against known OSRS examples
- [ ] Data validation function confirms Wiki compliance
- [ ] API server runs with proper error handling

**Wiki References:**
- https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Combat_level
- https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Damage_per_second/Melee
- Individual enemy pages for stat verification

**Dependencies:** None (foundational task)
**Blocks:** All Phase 1 tasks

## Task 3: [agent/backend-infra] Basic Colyseus Multiplayer Server

**Title:** `[AGENT TASK] [agent/backend-infra] Setup Basic Colyseus GameRoom with Logging`

**Priority:** HIGH - Required for multiplayer foundation

**Agent:** agent/backend-infra (The Architect)

**Description:**
Set up the foundational multiplayer server infrastructure using Colyseus that will handle authoritative game state and player connections.

**Specific Requirements:**

1. **Colyseus Server Setup:**
   - Node.js/TypeScript Colyseus server
   - Single GameRoom class: `RuneRogueRoom`
   - Basic room schema for player connections
   - Express.js server wrapper

2. **Connection Logging:**
   - Log when players join the room
   - Log when players leave the room
   - Log basic room state (player count)
   - Structured logging with timestamps

3. **Basic Room Management:**
   - Room creation on demand
   - Maximum 4 players per room (Discord group limit)
   - Room cleanup when empty
   - Basic error handling

4. **Development Setup:**
   - Local development server on port 2567
   - Hot reload for development
   - Environment configuration
   - Docker configuration for future deployment

**Technical Implementation:**
- Package: `packages/game-server/`
- Colyseus ^0.15.0 with TypeScript
- Express.js for HTTP endpoints
- WebSocket connections for real-time multiplayer
- Structured logging with winston or similar

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Colyseus server starts successfully on port 2567
- [ ] GameRoom accepts player connections
- [ ] Connection/disconnection events are properly logged
- [ ] Room state is maintained and accessible
- [ ] Server handles multiple concurrent rooms
- [ ] Clean shutdown and cleanup procedures
- [ ] Docker container builds and runs
- [ ] Health check endpoint returns server status

**Dependencies:** None (independent infrastructure task)
**Blocks:** Phase 1 player synchronization tasks

## Task 4: [agent/qa-tester] Validation Test Framework Setup

**Title:** `[AGENT TASK] [agent/qa-tester] Create OSRS Formula Validation Test Framework`

**Priority:** HIGH - Required for ensuring OSRS accuracy

**Agent:** agent/qa-tester (The Inquisitor)

**Description:**
Establish the comprehensive testing framework that will validate all OSRS calculations against Wiki specifications and ensure game fidelity.

**Specific Requirements:**

1. **Test Framework Setup:**
   - Jest configuration for monorepo testing
   - Test utilities for OSRS formula validation
   - Mock data generators for consistent testing
   - Performance benchmarks for calculations

2. **OSRS Formula Validation Tests:**
   - Combat max hit validation against known examples
   - Combat accuracy validation against known examples
   - Enemy stat verification against Wiki data
   - Combat level calculation verification

3. **Cross-Package Integration Tests:**
   - osrs-data API response validation
   - game-server room functionality tests
   - End-to-end calculation pipeline tests

4. **Continuous Validation:**
   - Automated test runner configuration
   - Wiki data freshness checks
   - Regression test suite
   - Performance monitoring

**Technical Implementation:**
- Root-level Jest configuration
- Package-specific test configurations
- Shared test utilities in `packages/shared/`
- Integration with GitHub Actions (future)

**Test Data Examples:**
```typescript
// Known OSRS calculation examples to validate against
const OSRS_TEST_CASES = [
  {
    name: "Base player max hit",
    strength: 10,
    strengthBonus: 0,
    expectedMaxHit: 1
  },
  {
    name: "Goblin combat level",
    attack: 1, defence: 1, hitpoints: 5,
    expectedCombatLevel: 2
  }
];
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Jest runs successfully across all packages
- [ ] OSRS formula validation tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests verify cross-package functionality
- [ ] Test coverage reports generated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Automated test discovery and execution
- [ ] Clear test failure reporting with OSRS Wiki references
- [ ] Mock data generators for repeatable tests

**Dependencies:** 
- Depends on Task 2 (osrs-data) for initial test data
- Depends on Task 3 (game-server) for integration tests

**Blocks:** All development quality assurance

## Phase 0 Summary

**Total Tasks:** 4 (1 Complete, 3 Pending)
**Critical Path:** Task 2 â†’ Task 4 â†’ Phase 1 begins
**Independent:** Task 3 (can run parallel with Task 2)

**Phase 0 Goals:**
- âœ… Establish project architecture
- ðŸ”„ Create OSRS data foundation  
- ðŸ”„ Setup multiplayer infrastructure
- ðŸ”„ Implement quality assurance framework

**Phase 1 Prerequisites:**
All Phase 0 tasks must be complete before Phase 1 begins. The data pipeline, server infrastructure, and testing framework form the foundation for gameplay implementation.

**Next Phase Preview:**
Phase 1 will implement the core gameplay vertical slice with player movement, basic combat, and the first enemy interaction.
