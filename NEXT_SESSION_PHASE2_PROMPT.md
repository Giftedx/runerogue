# RuneRogue Phase 2 - Next Session Prompt

## 🎉 Phase 1 Complete - Moving to Phase 2!

**Congratulations!** Phase 1 of the RuneRogue enemy system integration is **COMPLETE**. All core functionality is working:

✅ Enemy spawning, movement, and AI  
✅ Player-enemy combat with real-time sync  
✅ Death/respawn mechanics  
✅ Comprehensive test infrastructure  
✅ Multiplayer synchronization verified

## 🎯 Phase 2 Objectives

**Primary Goal**: Transform the working enemy system into a polished, visually-rich OSRS-authentic multiplayer game experience.

### Phase 2A: Visual Enemy Rendering (Priority 1)

**Current State**: Enemies work perfectly on the server side and in test clients, but are not visually rendered in the web client.

**Goal**: Connect the Phaser client (`GameScene.ts`) to display enemies with sprites, animations, and health bars.

**Key Tasks**:

1. **Connect Phaser client to enemy room**: Update client to join the enemy-enabled room
2. **Enemy sprite rendering**: Add goblin and spider sprites to the game
3. **Enemy health bars**: Visual health indicators above enemies
4. **Combat visual feedback**: Damage numbers, attack animations
5. **Enemy state sync**: Ensure visual enemies sync with server state

**Files to Focus On**:

- `packages/phaser-client/src/scenes/GameScene.ts` (843 lines of sophisticated game logic)
- `packages/phaser-client/src/network/NetworkManager.ts` (client-server communication)
- `packages/phaser-client/src/ui/components/ConnectionTest.tsx` (already enhanced with enemy stats)

### Phase 2B: OSRS Combat Enhancement (Priority 2)

**Goal**: Replace basic damage calculations with authentic OSRS combat formulas.

**Key Tasks**:

1. **Import OSRS combat data**: Use `packages/osrs-data/` for authentic formulas
2. **Player equipment system**: Add weapons/armor affecting combat stats
3. **Combat skill calculations**: Implement attack/strength/defense levels
4. **Prayer system integration**: Add prayer effects on combat
5. **Combat experience**: Award XP for successful attacks

### Phase 2C: Game World Enhancement (Priority 3)

**Goal**: Create a more immersive game world with OSRS-style features.

**Key Tasks**:

1. **Multiple enemy types**: Expand beyond goblins/spiders
2. **Area-based spawning**: Different enemies in different regions
3. **Player progression**: Levels, skills, equipment upgrades
4. **Game UI polish**: Inventory, skills, combat interface
5. **Sound effects**: Combat sounds, ambient audio

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps (First 2 Hours)

### Step 1: Phaser Client Enemy Rendering

The `GameScene.ts` file already has sophisticated rendering capabilities. The task is to:

1. **Update room connection**: Change from "test" room to the enemy-enabled room
2. **Add enemy sprites**: Create sprite assets for goblins and spiders
3. **Implement enemy rendering loop**: Similar to existing player rendering
4. **Add enemy health bars**: Use existing health bar patterns

**Expected Outcome**: Players can see enemies moving around the game world and attacking them visually.

### Step 2: Combat Visual Feedback

1. **Damage numbers**: Floating damage text when combat occurs
2. **Attack animations**: Visual feedback for player and enemy attacks
3. **Combat sound effects**: Audio cues for successful hits
4. **Death animations**: Visual effects when enemies/players die

**Expected Outcome**: Combat feels engaging and provides clear visual feedback.

## 📊 Current Technical State

### What's Working Perfectly:

- **Server-side enemy system**: 100% functional
- **Real-time multiplayer sync**: Verified working
- **Combat mechanics**: Bidirectional combat working
- **Test infrastructure**: Comprehensive testing in place

### What Needs Phase 2 Work:

- **Visual rendering**: Enemies not yet visible in web client
- **OSRS authenticity**: Using basic damage formulas instead of OSRS formulas
- **Game polish**: UI, sound, visual effects need enhancement
- **Content depth**: More enemy types, areas, progression systems

## 🎮 Testing Validation

Before starting Phase 2, verify Phase 1 is still working:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the server
cd c:\Users\aggis\GitHub\runerogue
pnpm --filter @runerogue/game-server dev

# Terminal 2: Test enemy system
node test-enemy-system.js
```

**Expected Result**: Should see real-time enemy spawning, movement, combat, and death/respawn cycles.

## 📋 Phase 2 Success Criteria

By the end of Phase 2, the game should have:

- [ ] **Visual enemy rendering**: Players can see enemies in the Phaser client
- [ ] **Combat visual feedback**: Damage numbers, animations, sound effects
- [ ] **OSRS-authentic combat**: Real OSRS damage formulas and mechanics
- [ ] **Player progression**: Basic leveling and equipment systems
- [ ] **Polished UI**: Professional-looking game interface
- [ ] **Multiple enemy types**: Varied content beyond goblins/spiders
- [ ] **60fps performance**: Smooth gameplay even with visual enhancements

## 🛠️ Development Environment Ready

All development tools are set up and working:

- ✅ **Server**: `pnpm --filter @runerogue/game-server dev`
- ✅ **Client**: `pnpm --filter @runerogue/phaser-client dev`
- ✅ **Test infrastructure**: `node test-enemy-system.js`
- ✅ **Git repository**: All changes committed and tracked

## 🎯 Recommended Approach

**Option 1: Visual-First Approach** (Recommended)

- Start with Phaser client enemy rendering
- Get enemies visually appearing and moving
- Add combat visual feedback
- Then enhance with OSRS mechanics

**Option 2: Mechanics-First Approach**

- Start with OSRS combat formula integration
- Enhance server-side mechanics
- Then add visual improvements

**Recommendation**: Take the visual-first approach since players need to see enemies to fully experience the combat system.

## 📁 Key Files for Phase 2

**Phaser Client (Visual Rendering)**:

- `packages/phaser-client/src/scenes/GameScene.ts`
- `packages/phaser-client/src/network/NetworkManager.ts`
- `packages/phaser-client/src/ui/components/ConnectionTest.tsx`

**OSRS Data Integration**:

- `packages/osrs-data/` (combat formulas, items, NPCs)
- `packages/shared/src/schemas/` (data models)

**Server Enhancement**:

- `packages/game-server/src/rooms/SimpleTestRoom.ts` (already complete!)
- `packages/game-server/src/systems/` (combat enhancements)

## 🏆 Phase 1 Achievement Summary

Phase 1 delivered a **fully functional multiplayer enemy system**:

- Real-time enemy spawning and AI
- Bidirectional player-enemy combat
- Death and respawn mechanics
- Multiplayer synchronization
- Comprehensive testing infrastructure

**The foundation is solid - now let's make it beautiful and authentic!** 🎮
