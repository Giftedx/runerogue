# Light-Spec Rule Set

- Use consistent 2-space indentation throughout the project.
- Export all game modules via `index.ts` barrel files.
- Document public API functions and game mechanics with JSDoc/TSDoc.
- Write unit tests for each player action and combat scenario.
- Ensure Discord notifications are sent for significant game events.
