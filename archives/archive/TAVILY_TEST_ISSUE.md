## Description

**TAVILY MCP INTEGRATION TEST**: Research the current state of Old School RuneScape's Grand Exchange API and third-party data sources to validate our Tavily MCP server integration and gather intelligence for improving our economy tracking capabilities.

This is a test issue to validate our newly configured Tavily MCP server integration with GitHub Copilot Agents. The goal is to ensure Tavily search and content extraction tools are working properly while gathering useful information for our RuneRogue project.

## Custom MCP Tool Options

### For Web Search Tasks

- Query: "Old School RuneScape Grand Exchange API third-party data sources 2025 economy tracking"
- Search Depth: advanced
- Topic: general
- Max Results: 15
- Include Answer: true

### For Content Extraction Tasks

- URLs: [
  "https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Application_programming_interface",
  "https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Grand_Exchange",
  "https://prices.runescape.wiki/"
  ]
- Extract Depth: advanced
- Include Images: false

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Tavily Search Validation**: Confirm that `tavily_search` tool executes successfully and returns relevant results about OSRS economy APIs
- [ ] **Content Extraction Validation**: Verify that `tavily_extract` tool can extract content from OSRS Wiki pages
- [ ] **Data Quality Assessment**: Evaluate the relevance and accuracy of returned search results
- [ ] **API Source Discovery**: Identify at least 3 current OSRS economy data sources/APIs
- [ ] **Integration Opportunities**: Document potential integration points for our RuneRogue project
- [ ] **Performance Metrics**: Note response times and result quality for future optimization

## Expected Behavior

1. The GitHub Copilot Agent should automatically detect and use the Tavily MCP tools
2. Search results should include recent information about OSRS economy tracking
3. Extracted content should provide detailed API documentation and data source information
4. Results should be formatted clearly with sources and timestamps

## Success Indicators

- ✅ No MCP server connection errors
- ✅ Tavily API key authentication works
- ✅ Search returns 10+ relevant results
- ✅ Content extraction works for all provided URLs
- ✅ Results include actionable intelligence for our project

## Debug Information

If the integration fails, check:

- TAVILY_API_KEY environment variable is set
- NPX can install @mcptools/mcp-tavily
- MCP server configuration in `.github/copilot/mcp_config.json`
- Network connectivity to Tavily API

## Follow-up Tasks

Based on results from this test:

- [ ] Create additional test cases for different search patterns
- [ ] Optimize query templates for OSRS-specific research
- [ ] Document successful usage patterns
- [ ] Set up regular market intelligence gathering workflows
