# Legacy Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the steps to migrate and deprecate the legacy Flask endpoints, which handle web scraping and social features.

## Current Endpoints

- Endpoints for web scraping
- Endpoints for social interactions

## Migration Steps

1. **Identify Deprecated Endpoints:**
   - List all Flask endpoints that are deprecated.

2. **Develop Replacement Endpoints:**
   - Implement new endpoints in the TypeScript Game Server and Python MCP server where applicable.

3. **Dual Operation:**
   - Run legacy and new endpoints in parallel while clients transition.

4. **Client Notifications:**
   - Update client documentation and notify stakeholders of upcoming changes.

5. **Testing:**
   - Conduct comprehensive integration testing to ensure consistency between old and new endpoints.

6. **Gradual Decommissioning:**
   - Slowly disable legacy endpoints while monitoring performance and user feedback.

7. **Rollback Strategy:**
   - Ensure backup plans are in place in case of critical failures.

## Timeline

- **Phase 1:** Development and internal testing (2 weeks)
- **Phase 2:** Pilot parallel operation with select users (1 week)
- **Phase 3:** Full transition and deprecation of legacy endpoints (1 week)

## Review and Approval

- Ensure all changes are reviewed by the integration team before production rollout.
