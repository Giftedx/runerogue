# 🚀 MULTIPLAYER DEVELOPMENT SESSION - RUNEROGUE

## SESSION MISSION 🎯

Build real-time 2-4 player movement synchronization and auto-combat system on the optimized ECS foundation.

**Time Budget:** 4-6 hours  
**Difficulty:** High (Real-time Multiplayer)  
**Expected Outcome:** Working multiplayer prototype with synchronized movement and combat

---

## FOUNDATION STATUS ✅

**ECS Performance:** OPTIMIZED - 38 FPS stable (45-50+ FPS production ready)  
**Test Coverage:** 23/26 tests passing (88.5%) - core systems validated  
**Infrastructure:** Colyseus + bitECS integration working  
**Architecture:** Production-ready with comprehensive error handling

**Ready for multiplayer development!**

## DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES

### 🎮 **TASK 1: Real-time Player Movement (2-3 hours)**

**Goal:** 2+ players moving simultaneously with smooth synchronization

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Add movement message handlers to GameRoom.ts
2. Implement server-side movement validation (speed limits, boundaries)  
3. Create position broadcasting via Colyseus state
4. Add interpolation for smooth remote player movement
5. Test with multiple concurrent players

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] 2+ players can move independently without desync
- [ ] Movement respects OSRS walking speed (1 tile/0.6s)
- [ ] Position updates have <50ms latency
- [ ] No boundary/collision bypassing

### ⚔️ **TASK 2: Auto-Combat & Enemy Waves (1-2 hours)**

**Goal:** Enemies spawn in waves and automatically engage players

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Enhance WaveManager with enemy positioning
2. Add automatic target acquisition for enemies  
3. Implement OSRS-accurate damage calculations
4. Create enemy pathfinding toward players
5. Add XP gain and progression feedback

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Enemies spawn in escalating waves
- [ ] Combat damage matches OSRS formulas exactly
- [ ] XP rates follow authentic OSRS progression
- [ ] Enemies intelligently target nearest players

### 📊 **TASK 3: Real-time UI & Feedback (1 hour)**

**Goal:** Visual feedback for multiplayer combat

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Display health bars above players/enemies
2. Show damage numbers and XP notifications
3. Add level-up effects and progression indicators
4. Create wave progress displays

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Health changes visible in real-time
- [ ] Damage numbers appear on successful hits
- [ ] XP and level changes show immediately
- [ ] Wave progress clearly communicated
