# GitHub Copilot Agent TODO Search - Next Steps Continuation Prompt

## CURRENT STATUS
The GitHub Copilot Agent TODO search functionality has been implemented and committed to the repository. The code is ready but needs verification and potential troubleshooting.

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS TO EXECUTE

### 1. VERIFY WORKFLOW EXECUTION
First, check if the GitHub Actions workflow has executed successfully:

```
Please check the GitHub Actions workflow status at:
https://github.com/Giftedx/runerogue/actions

Look for recent workflow runs triggered by issue assignments or pushes to verify if the copilot-agent-tasks.yml workflow executed successfully.
```

### 2. CHECK ISSUE COMMENT STATUS
Verify if the bot successfully posted a comment on the target issue:

```
Check GitHub issue #42 at:
https://github.com/Giftedx/runerogue/issues/42

Look for a comment from github-copilot[bot] containing TODO search results. The comment should include:
- A list of actual TODO comments from economy/grand_exchange.py (lines 183, 399, 572)
- Categorized results distinguishing actionable TODOs from meta references
- Properly formatted markdown output
```

### 3. TROUBLESHOOT IF WORKFLOW FAILED
If the workflow failed or no comment was posted, execute these debugging steps:

#### A. Check Workflow Logs
```
Examine the workflow logs in GitHub Actions for:
- PyGithub import errors (should be resolved with our requirements.txt update)
- Git command execution failures  
- Script execution errors
- Permission issues with posting comments
```

#### B. Re-trigger Workflow
```
If needed, re-trigger the workflow by:
1. Going to issue #42: https://github.com/Giftedx/runerogue/issues/42
2. Adding a comment: "@github/copilot please search for TODO comments in this repository"
3. Or assigning the issue to @github/copilot
```

#### C. Test Local Functionality
```
If workflow issues persist, test the functionality locally by running:

cd /workspaces/runerogue
python test_todo_functionality.py

This will verify the TODO search logic works correctly outside of the GitHub Actions environment.
```

### 4. VALIDATE TODO SEARCH RESULTS
Once the bot comment appears, verify the results are accurate:

#### Expected Results Should Include:
```
‚úÖ ACTUAL TODO COMMENTS (3 found):
- economy/grand_exchange.py:183 - TODO: Implement item search functionality
- economy/grand_exchange.py:399 - TODO: Add price history tracking  
- economy/grand_exchange.py:572 - TODO: Implement advanced filtering

üìù TODO REFERENCES (multiple found):
- Various test files and configuration references
- Meta-comments about TODO functionality
```

### 5. HANDLE POTENTIAL ISSUES

#### If No Comment Posted:
```
1. Check workflow permissions - ensure GITHUB_TOKEN has issue write access
2. Verify the workflow trigger conditions match the issue assignment
3. Check if rate limits or API quotas are blocking the comment posting
```

#### If Incorrect Results:
```
1. Verify the git grep command is finding all TODO instances
2. Check if the categorization logic correctly distinguishes actual TODOs
3. Ensure the file paths in results are accurate and clickable
```

#### If Workflow Errors Persist:
```
1. Check for any merge conflicts or file corruption
2. Verify all dependencies in requirements.txt are correctly specified
3. Consider using the backup script: scripts/simple_todo_search.py
4. Review the workflow file .github/workflows/copilot-agent-tasks.yml for configuration issues
```

### 6. FINAL VERIFICATION STEPS
Once everything is working:

#### A. Test Complete Workflow
```
1. Create a new test issue
2. Assign it to @github/copilot with TODO search request
3. Verify the complete end-to-end functionality
```

#### B. Document Success
```
1. Update project documentation with the new TODO search capability
2. Add examples of how to use the feature
3. Document any troubleshooting steps that were required
```

### 7. OPTIMIZATION (IF TIME PERMITS)
Consider these enhancements:

```
1. Add support for other comment types (FIXME, HACK, NOTE)
2. Implement file filtering options
3. Add line count and summary statistics
4. Include file modification dates in results
5. Add links to specific line numbers in GitHub
```
