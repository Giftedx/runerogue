## 🚀 **DEVELOPMENT TASKS - DETAILED BREAKDOWN**

### **TASK 1: Real-time Player Movement (90 minutes)**

**Goal**: 2+ players can move simultaneously with smooth synchronization

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Client Input Handling** (30 min)
   ```typescript
   // In GameRoom.ts - add message handler
   onMessage("player_move", (client, data: {x: number, y: number, direction: string}) => {
     this.validateAndApplyMovement(client.sessionId, data);
   });
   ```

2. **Server-side Movement Validation** (30 min)
   ```typescript
   // Validate movement speed, boundaries, collisions
   private validateAndApplyMovement(playerId: string, movement: MovementData) {
     // Check speed limits (OSRS walking speed: 1 tile/0.6s)
     // Validate position boundaries
     // Apply to ECS Transform component
     // Broadcast to other players
   }
   ```

3. **State Broadcasting** (30 min)
   ```typescript
   // Update Colyseus schema and broadcast
   private broadcastPlayerPositions() {
     this.state.players.forEach(player => {
       // Sync ECS Transform to Colyseus schema
       // Broadcast position updates
     });
   }
   ```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] 2 players can move independently without desync
- [ ] Movement speed matches OSRS walking speed
- [ ] Position updates broadcast <50ms latency
- [ ] No collision detection bypassing

### **TASK 2: Enemy Spawning & Auto-Combat (75 minutes)**

**Goal**: Enemies spawn in waves, automatically engage players with OSRS combat

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Wave-based Enemy Spawning** (25 min)
   ```typescript
   // In WaveManager.ts - enhance existing system
   private spawnEnemiesForWave(waveNumber: number) {
     const enemyCount = 5 + (waveNumber * 2); // Scaling difficulty
     // Create enemy entities with Combat, Health, Transform components
     // Use authentic OSRS enemy stats
   }
   ```

2. **Auto-Combat Targeting** (25 min)
   ```typescript
   // In CombatSystem.ts - add automatic targeting
   private findNearestTarget(entityId: number): number | null {
     // Range-based targeting (OSRS melee range: 1 tile)
     // Priority: closest enemy/player
     // Validate line of sight
   }
   ```

3. **OSRS Damage Calculation** (25 min)
   ```typescript
   // Use existing OSRS formulas from packages/osrs-data/
   private calculateDamage(attacker: Entity, defender: Entity): number {
     // Apply exact OSRS damage formula
     // Factor in attack/strength/defence levels
     // Apply equipment bonuses
     // Handle special attacks and effects
   }
   ```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Enemies spawn correctly based on wave number
- [ ] Auto-combat engages at correct OSRS range (1 tile for melee)
- [ ] Damage calculations match OSRS Wiki values
- [ ] XP gained matches OSRS rates (4 XP per damage in Attack/Strength)

### **TASK 3: UI & Visual Feedback (45 minutes)**

**Goal**: Clear visual feedback for health, damage, XP, and wave progress

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Health Bar System** (15 min)
   ```typescript
   // Add health bar component to all entities
   interface HealthBarData {
     entityId: number;
     currentHP: number;
     maxHP: number;
     position: {x: number, y: number};
   }
   ```

2. **Damage Numbers** (15 min)
   ```typescript
   // Broadcast damage events for visual effects
   this.broadcast("damage_dealt", {
     targetId: defenderId,
     damage: damageAmount,
     damageType: "melee" | "ranged" | "magic",
     isCritical: false
   });
   ```

3. **XP & Level Notifications** (15 min)
   ```typescript
   // Send XP gain events with OSRS-style feedback
   this.broadcast("xp_gained", {
     playerId: player.id,
     skill: "attack" | "strength" | "defence" | "hitpoints",
     xpGained: amount,
     newLevel: newLevel || null
   });
   ```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Health bars visible above all entities
- [ ] Damage numbers appear on hit with correct values
- [ ] XP notifications show exact OSRS XP amounts
- [ ] Level up celebrations trigger at correct XP thresholds
