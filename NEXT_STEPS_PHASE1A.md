## 🔧 Technical Implementation Guide

### JSON Message Protocol Structure

Based on working `JsonGameRoom`, use these message types:

```javascript
// Client to Server Messages
room.send("move", { x: newX, y: newY });
room.send("attack", { targetSessionId: "player123" });
room.send("chat", { message: "Hello world!" });

// Server to Client Messages
room.onMessage("fullState", (gameState) => {
  /* render full state */
});
room.onMessage("playerUpdate", (update) => {
  /* update player position */
});
room.onMessage("combatUpdate", (combat) => {
  /* handle combat result */
});
room.onMessage("chatMessage", (chat) => {
  /* display chat */
});
```

### Phaser Client Architecture Pattern

```javascript
class GameScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  async create() {
    // Initialize Colyseus connection
    this.room = await client.joinOrCreate("runerogue", { username: "Player" });

    // Set up JSON message handlers
    this.room.onMessage("fullState", (state) => this.handleFullState(state));
    this.room.onMessage("playerUpdate", (update) => this.updatePlayer(update));

    // Set up input handling
    this.setupMovementControls();
  }

  handleFullState(gameState) {
    // Render all players from JSON state
    Object.values(gameState.players).forEach((player) => {
      this.renderPlayer(player);
    });
  }
}
```

### Integration with OSRS Data

```javascript
// Import OSRS calculations
import { CombatCalculator } from '@runerogue/osrs-data';

// In JsonGameRoom
handleCombat(attacker, defender) {
  const damage = CombatCalculator.calculateDamage(
    attacker.combatStats,
    defender.combatStats
  );

  defender.health -= damage;
  this.broadcast('combatUpdate', { damage, defenderId: defender.id });
}
```

## 🎮 Expected Deliverables

After completing these steps, you should have:

1. **Working Phaser Multiplayer Client**:

   - Visual player representation with movement
   - Real-time synchronization of 2-4 players
   - Basic UI showing player info

2. **OSRS-Authentic Combat System**:

   - Server-side combat calculations using real OSRS formulas
   - Health/damage system with visual feedback
   - Combat level displays

3. **Stable Multiplayer Foundation**:

   - No connection issues or desync
   - Graceful error handling
   - Performance targets met (60 FPS client, 30 FPS server)

4. **Ready for Phase 2**:
