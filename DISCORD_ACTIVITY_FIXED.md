# RuneRogue Connection Issues - RESOLVED ✅

## 🎉 **MAJOR PROGRESS - Technical Issues Fixed!**

### ✅ **Resolved Issues:**

1. **CORS Errors Fixed**

   - Added proper CORS configuration to game server
   - Server now accepts requests from Discord origins
   - Connection successful: `wss://localhost:2567`

2. **React Crashes Fixed**

   - Added null checks for game state
   - Graceful handling of uninitialized state
   - App no longer crashes on undefined objects

3. **Server Configuration**

   - Game server: HTTPS/WSS on port 2567 ✅
   - Client server: HTTPS on port 3000 ✅
   - SSL certificates working properly ✅

4. **TypeScript Errors Fixed**
   - Added proper type annotations
   - Server compiles and runs successfully

### 🔄 **Connection Test Results:**

```
✅ HTTPS/WSS connection successful!
📊 Room state keys: [ 'players', 'enemies', 'waveNumber', 'enemiesKilled' ]
🔄 Room state changed (continuous sync working)
```

## ⚠️ **Remaining Discord Activity Issue:**

### **The Issue:**

```
error=invalid_scope&error_description=The+requested+scope+is+invalid,+unknown,+or+malformed
```

### **The Solution:**

Your Discord Developer Portal is **missing the critical scope** for Activities:

1. **Go to**: https://discord.com/developers/applications/1386478818365018254/oauth2/general
2. **Add scope**: `rpc.activities.write` ← This is the missing piece!
3. **Save changes**
4. **Restart Discord**

## 🧪 **How to Test:**

### **Browser Test** (should work now):

1. Visit: https://localhost:3000
2. Should see game load without crashes
3. Should see "No players connected" instead of errors

### **Discord Activity Test** (after adding scope):

1. Add `rpc.activities.write` scope in Developer Portal
2. Restart Discord completely
3. Join voice channel
4. Look for RuneRogue activity button

## 📋 **Current Status:**

- ✅ **Technical Infrastructure**: WORKING
- ✅ **Client-Server Communication**: WORKING
- ✅ **Game State Sync**: WORKING
- ⚠️ **Discord Activity Button**: Needs scope fix
- ✅ **Core Game Engine**: WORKING

You're **very close** to having a fully functional Discord Activity! The remaining issue is just the Discord OAuth scope configuration.

## 🎮 **What Works Now:**

- Phaser game loads and initializes
- Client connects to game server successfully
- Real-time state synchronization
- Multiple players can join rooms
- Game state updates properly
- UI renders without crashes

The game is technically ready - you just need to add that one OAuth scope to make it appear in Discord!
