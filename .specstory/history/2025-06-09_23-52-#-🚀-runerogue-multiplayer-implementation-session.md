# 🚀 RuneRogue Multiplayer Implementation Session

## Current Project State (Accurate as of Last Session)

### ✅ What's Working

- **ECS Automation Manager**: Production-ready with 88.5% test coverage (23/26 passing)
- **Performance**: Stable 38-44 FPS in test environment (production expected 45-50+ FPS)
- **Core Systems**: GameRoom lifecycle, ECS architecture, OSRS data pipeline all functional
- **Infrastructure**: Colyseus + bitECS integration validated and working

### 🎯 Session Objective

Transform RuneRogue from "stable foundation" to "playable multiplayer prototype" with 2-4 players moving and fighting together in real-time.

## 📋 Prioritized Task List (4-6 Hour Session)

### Phase 1: Movement Synchronization (2-3 hours)

**Goal**: Players can join a room and see each other move in real-time

1. **Implement Movement Message Handler** in `GameRoom.ts`

```typescript
// filepath: server-ts/src/server/game/GameRoom.ts
// Add to onMessage handlers
this.onMessage("move", (client, data: { x: number; y: number }) => {
  // Validate movement
  // Update ECS position component
  // Broadcast to other players
});
```

2. **Create MovementSystem** for position interpolation

```typescript
// filepath: server-ts/src/server/ecs/systems/MovementSystem.ts
export const MovementSystem = (world: World) => {
  const query = defineQuery([Position, Velocity, NetworkId]);
  return () => {
    const entities = query(world);
    // Interpolate positions
    // Apply OSRS movement speed (1 tile per 0.6s)
    // Handle collision detection
  };
};
```

3. **Add Client Prediction** for responsive movement

- Store pending moves on client
- Apply moves immediately locally
- Reconcile with server state
- Smooth interpolation between updates

### Phase 2: Combat & Enemy Waves (1-2 hours)

**Goal**: Auto-combat with OSRS-accurate damage calculations

1. **Enhance WaveManager** with progressive difficulty

```typescript
// filepath: server-ts/src/server/game/WaveManager.ts
// Add enemy spawn patterns
// Increase difficulty per wave
// Track wave completion
```

2. **Implement Auto-targeting** in CombatSystem

```typescript
// filepath: server-ts/src/server/ecs/systems/CombatSystem.ts
// Find nearest enemy within range
// Apply OSRS combat formulas
// Calculate XP gains
// Broadcast damage events
```

3. **Add Combat Feedback**

- Damage numbers floating text
- Hit splats (OSRS-style)
- XP drops on kill
- Death animations

### Phase 3: UI & Visual Feedback (1 hour)

**Goal**: Clear visual representation of game state

1. **Health & Prayer Bars**

- Render above player sprites
- Update in real-time
- Show prayer drain

2. **Wave Progress UI**

- Current wave number
- Enemies remaining
- Time survived
- XP gained this session

3. **Multiplayer Indicators**

- Player names above characters
- Different colors per player
- Connection status icons

### Key Code Patterns to Follow

**ECS Component Definition**:

```typescript
export const NetworkId = defineComponent({
  id: Types.ui32,
  playerId: Types.ui8,
});
```

**System Pattern**:

```typescript
export const createSystem = (world: World) => {
  const query = defineQuery([Component1, Component2]);

  return (deltaTime: number) => {
    const entities = query(world);
    for (let i = 0; i < entities.length; i++) {
      const eid = entities[i];
      // Process entity
    }
  };
};
```

**Colyseus Message Handler**:

```typescript
this.onMessage("action", (client, data) => {
  const player = this.state.players.get(client.sessionId);
  if (!player) return;

  // Validate action
  // Update ECS
  // Broadcast changes
});
```

## 📊 Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Multiplayer (Must Have)

- [ ] 2+ players can join the same room
- [ ] Players see each other move in real-time
- [ ] Movement is smooth (no teleporting)
- [ ] Basic enemies spawn and can be killed
- [ ] Combat damage appears on screen

### Good Multiplayer Experience (Should Have)

- [ ] 4 players simultaneous without lag
- [ ] Auto-combat targets nearest enemy
- [ ] XP gains show on screen
- [ ] Wave progression is synchronized
- [ ] Death/respawn mechanics work

### Excellent Implementation (Nice to Have)

- [ ] Client prediction for zero-latency feel
- [ ] Smooth interpolation between updates
- [ ] Party UI showing all player stats
- [ ] Damage numbers with OSRS font
- [ ] Prayer drain visualization

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't Trust Client Input**

   - Always validate movement speed
   - Check attack ranges server-side
   - Verify XP calculations

2. **Avoid State Desync**

   - Single source of truth (server)
   - Consistent update order
   - Handle disconnections gracefully

3. **Performance Traps**
   - Don't query all entities every frame
   - Use spatial partitioning for range checks
   - Batch network messages

## 🧪 Testing Your Implementation

### Quick Validation Tests

```bash
# Start server
cd server-ts && npm run dev

# In another terminal, run multiplayer test
npm test -- multiplayer.test.ts

# Manual testing: Open multiple browser tabs
# Each should connect as a different player
```

### Performance Validation

- Monitor FPS with 4 players
- Check network message frequency
- Ensure memory usage is stable
- Verify no lag spikes during combat

## 📚 Reference Documentation

### OSRS Mechanics

- Movement: 1 tile per 0.6 seconds (walking)
- Combat: Attack speed varies by weapon (2.4s - 3.6s)
- XP Formula: `4 * damage dealt` for combat XP

## 🎮 Final Deliverable

By the end of this session, you should have:

1. A video/GIF showing 2+ players moving together
2. Combat working with damage numbers
3. At least one complete wave with multiple players
4. Updated tests validating multiplayer functionality

## 💡 Getting Started

1. First, check current test status:

   ```bash
   cd server-ts && npm test
   ```

2. Start implementing movement handler in GameRoom.ts

3. Test with 2 browser tabs after each major change

4. Commit working code frequently

Remember: Focus on making it work first, then optimize. The foundation is solid - build the multiplayer experience that makes RuneRogue unique!

## 🆘 If You Get Stuck

1. Check existing ECS systems for patterns
2. Reference the working test files
3. Use the Colyseus monitor (http://localhost:2567/colyseus)
4. Validate against OSRS Wiki for mechanics
5. Keep commits small and focused

## 📋 Current Project Context

### Working Files to Reference

- `server-ts/src/server/ecs/ECSAutomationManager.ts` - Performance optimized with test environment detection
- `server-ts/src/server/game/GameRoom.ts` - Has player join/leave, needs movement handlers
- `server-ts/src/server/ecs/systems/` - Existing systems show patterns to follow
- `server-ts/tests/` - 23/26 tests passing, use as reference

### Key Architecture Decisions Made

- **Client**: Using Godot (NOT Phaser 3 as docs suggest)
- **Server**: Node.js + TypeScript + Colyseus + bitECS
- **Structure**: server-ts/ directory (NOT monorepo structure)
- **Performance**: Optimized for 45-50+ FPS in production

### OSRS Authenticity Requirements

- **Combat**: Use exact formulas from OSRS Wiki
- **Movement**: 1 tile per 0.6 seconds (walking speed)
- **XP Rates**: 4 \* damage dealt for combat XP
- **Prayer**: 1 point per 3 seconds base drain rate

Good luck! The foundation is ready - time to bring multiplayer RuneRogue to life! 🚀

_**Assistant**_

Here’s a step-by-step plan to implement Phase 1: Movement Synchronization for RuneRogue multiplayer, following your architecture, code standards, and OSRS authenticity requirements. I’ll begin with the server-side movement handler and system, then outline the client-side prediction, and finally add unit/integration tests.

---

## 1. Implement Movement Message Handler in `GameRoom.ts`

- Add a Colyseus message handler for `"move"` events.
- Validate movement (speed, bounds, anti-cheat).
- Update the ECS `Position` component for the player’s entity.
- Broadcast the new position to other players.

---

## 2. Create `MovementSystem.ts` for Position Interpolation

- Query all entities with `Position`, `Velocity`, and `NetworkId`.
- Interpolate positions based on velocity and delta time.
- Enforce OSRS movement speed (1 tile per 0.6s).
- Handle collision detection (basic for now).

---

## 3. Add Client Prediction (Design Outline)

- Store pending moves on the client.
- Apply moves immediately for responsiveness.
- Reconcile with server state on update.
- Smoothly interpolate between server updates.

---

## 4. Add/Update Unit & Integration Tests

- Test movement validation (speed, bounds).
- Test ECS position updates.
- Test multiplayer synchronization (2+ players).

---

### 1. `GameRoom.ts` — Add Movement Handler

**File:** `GameRoom.ts`

```typescript
import { Room, Client } from "colyseus";
import { World } from "bitecs";
import { Position, NetworkId } from "../ecs/components";
import { validateMovement } from "../utils/validation";

/**
 * Handles player movement messages, validates input, and updates ECS.
 * @param client - The Colyseus client sending the move.
 * @param data - The movement data ({ x, y }).
 */
this.onMessage("move", (client: Client, data: { x: number; y: number }) => {
  try {
    const player = this.state.players.get(client.sessionId);
    if (!player) return;

    // Validate movement (speed, bounds, anti-cheat)
    if (!validateMovement(player, data)) {
      // Optionally: log or kick for invalid movement
      return;
    }

    // Update ECS Position component
    const eid = player.entityId;
    if (typeof eid !== "number") return;

    Position.x[eid] = data.x;
    Position.y[eid] = data.y;

    // Optionally: broadcast to other players (Colyseus state sync handles this)
  } catch (err) {
    // Structured logging for debugging
    console.error("Movement handler error", {
      sessionId: client.sessionId,
      err,
    });
  }
});
```

---

### 2. `MovementSystem.ts` — ECS System

**File:** `MovementSystem.ts`

```typescript
import { defineQuery, IWorld } from "bitecs";
import { Position, Velocity, NetworkId } from "../components";

/**
 * OSRS walking speed: 1 tile per 0.6 seconds.
 */
const TILE_SIZE = 1;
const TILE_TIME = 0.6; // seconds

/**
 * MovementSystem interpolates entity positions based on velocity and deltaTime.
 * Enforces OSRS movement speed and handles basic collision.
 * @param world - The ECS world.
 */
export const MovementSystem = (world: IWorld) => {
  const query = defineQuery([Position, Velocity, NetworkId]);

  return (deltaTime: number) => {
    const entities = query(world);
    for (let i = 0; i < entities.length; i++) {
      const eid = entities[i];

      // Calculate max distance allowed this tick
      const maxDistance = (TILE_SIZE / TILE_TIME) * deltaTime;

      // Compute intended movement
      const dx = Velocity.x[eid] * deltaTime;
      const dy = Velocity.y[eid] * deltaTime;
      const distance = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);

      // Clamp to OSRS max speed
      if (distance > maxDistance) {
        const scale = maxDistance / distance;
        Position.x[eid] += dx * scale;
        Position.y[eid] += dy * scale;
      } else {
        Position.x[eid] += dx;
        Position.y[eid] += dy;
      }

      // TODO: Add collision detection here
    }
  };
};
```

---

### 3. Client Prediction (Design Outline)

**File:** `server-ts/src/client/systems/InputSystem.ts` (and/or Godot client)

```typescript
/**
 * Client-side movement prediction:
 * - Store pending moves in a queue.
 * - Apply moves immediately to local player.
 * - On server update, reconcile and interpolate.
 * - Smoothly interpolate between server and predicted state.
 */
```

_Implementation will depend on your Godot client, but the above is the pattern._

---

### 4. Unit & Integration Tests

**File:** `server-ts/tests/integration/multiplayer.test.ts`

```typescript
import { createTestRoom, sendMove, getPlayerPosition } from "./helpers";

/**
 * Integration test: 2 players move and see each other in real-time.
 */
describe("Multiplayer Movement Synchronization", () => {
  it("should synchronize movement between 2 players", async () => {
    const { room, clients } = await createTestRoom(2);

    // Player 1 moves
    await sendMove(clients[0], { x: 5, y: 5 });
    // Wait for state sync
    await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 100));

    // Player 2 should see Player 1 at new position
    const pos = getPlayerPosition(clients[1], clients[0].sessionId);
    expect(pos).toEqual({ x: 5, y: 5 });
  });

  it("should reject movement faster than OSRS speed", async () => {
    const { room, clients } = await createTestRoom(1);

    // Try to move too far in one tick
    await sendMove(clients[0], { x: 100, y: 100 });
    // Wait for state sync
    await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 100));

    // Position should not update to invalid value
    const pos = getPlayerPosition(clients[0], clients[0].sessionId);
    expect(pos.x).not.toBe(100);
    expect(pos.y).not.toBe(100);
  });
});
```

---

## Next Steps

- Implement the above code in the specified files.
- Add/adjust ECS components if needed (e.g., `Velocity`, `NetworkId`).
- Run and validate tests: `npm test -- multiplayer.test.ts`
- Manually test with 2+ clients for real-time movement.

Let me know if you want the full code for any specific file, or if you want to proceed to Phase 2 (Combat & Enemy Waves)!

_**User**_

Begin the agentic coding loop. Start by reassessing the current state of the gameplay systems (combat, loot, map, multiplayer sync) and Discord integration. Identify what is implemented, what is missing, and what should be prioritized next. Then proceed with the next most impactful step.

---

_**Assistant**_

### State of Gameplay Systems and Discord Integration

#### 1. **Combat System**

- **Implemented:**
  - There are two main files:
    - `CombatSystem.ts`: Contains combat types, effects, and interfaces, likely for high-level combat logic.
    - `CombatSystem.ts`: Implements ECS-based combat, with queries for combatants, OSRS tick rate, and state tracking.
  - Combat is handled both in legacy and ECS forms, with OSRS formulas and tick rates.
  - Player actions (attacks) are processed in `GameRoom.ts`, with health updates, death handling, loot drops, and Discord notifications for rare drops and deaths.
- **Missing/To Improve:**
  - Auto-targeting and full ECS migration for all combat logic.
  - More robust anti-cheat and validation for combat actions.
  - Integration tests for edge cases and multiplayer combat.

#### 2. **Loot System**

- **Implemented:**
  - `LootManager.ts` provides loot drop logic, including loot tables, item rolling, and loot drop creation.
  - Loot drops are spawned on NPC death and broadcast to clients.
- **Missing/To Improve:**
  - Loot pickup logic is referenced but not fully implemented.
  - Need to ensure loot is properly removed from the world and added to player inventory.
  - More tests for loot edge cases and rare drop handling.

#### 3. **Map System**

- **Implemented:**
  - `MapBlueprintSchema.ts` defines map schema and validation.
  - `GameRoom.ts` loads and validates maps, sets up collision maps, and initializes default maps.
- **Missing/To Improve:**
  - Dynamic map loading, multiple map support, and advanced features (spawns, interactive elements).
  - More robust collision and pathfinding logic.

#### 4. **Multiplayer Synchronization**

- **Implemented:**
  - `GameRoom.ts` manages player join/leave, state updates, and Colyseus message handlers for player actions, movement, trading, and more.
  - `multiplayerSync.ts` provides enhanced sync logic (delta updates, lag compensation, state snapshots).
  - ECS automation manager is used for system updates.
- **Missing/To Improve:**
  - Movement synchronization is basic: player position is set directly from client input without validation or anti-cheat.
  - No velocity, interpolation, or OSRS movement speed enforcement.
  - Needs robust anti-cheat, server authority, and smooth interpolation for all clients.

#### 5. **Discord Integration**

- **Implemented:**
  - Discord OAuth2 and event notification logic are present (`auth.ts`, `sendGameEventNotification`).
  - Game events (rare drops, deaths, trades) trigger Discord notifications.
- **Missing/To Improve:**
  - Full Discord Activities integration for launching/joining games from Discord.
  - More user feedback and Discord-driven game state changes.

---

## **Prioritization and Next Steps**

### **Highest Impact Next Step:**

**Upgrade movement synchronization to be OSRS-authentic, server-authoritative, and anti-cheat.**

- The current movement handler in `GameRoom.ts` simply sets player position from client input, which is insecure and not OSRS-accurate.
- Implement server-side movement validation, velocity, and ECS-based movement system.
- Add anti-cheat checks (max speed, collision, bounds).
- Broadcast validated positions to all clients.
- Lay groundwork for smooth multiplayer experience and client prediction.

---

### **Action Plan**

1. **Refactor movement handler in `GameRoom.ts`** to:

   - Accept movement intent (direction/target), not raw position.
   - Validate and update ECS velocity/position.
   - Enforce OSRS movement speed and collision.
   - Broadcast only validated, server-authoritative positions.

2. **Implement/upgrade ECS `MovementSystem`** to:

   - Process velocity and update positions per tick.
   - Clamp movement to OSRS speed.
   - Handle collision and bounds.

3. **Add unit/integration tests** for movement validation, anti-cheat, and multiplayer sync.

---

**Proceeding to implement the refactored movement handler and ECS movement system.** **Summary of Current State (Gameplay Systems & Discord Integration):**

---

### 1. **Combat System**

- **Implemented:** Both legacy and ECS-based combat systems exist. ECS system uses OSRS tick rate and queries for combatants. Player actions (attacks) are processed, with health updates, loot drops, and Discord notifications for rare drops and deaths.
- **Missing:** Full ECS migration for all combat logic, robust anti-cheat, and more integration tests.

### 2. **Loot System**

- **Implemented:** LootManager handles loot drops, loot tables, and item rolling. Loot is spawned on NPC death and broadcast to clients.
- **Missing:** Loot pickup logic, removal from world, and more edge case tests.

### 3. **Map System**

- **Implemented:** Map schema and validation, default map loading, collision map support.
- **Missing:** Dynamic map loading, advanced features (spawns, interactive elements), robust collision/pathfinding.

### 4. **Multiplayer Synchronization**

- **Implemented:** Colyseus manages player join/leave, state updates, and message handlers. ECSAutomationManager runs ECS systems (including MovementSystem). There is a basic movement handler, but it sets player position directly from client input.
- **Missing:** Server-authoritative movement, anti-cheat, velocity/interpolation, OSRS movement speed enforcement, and smooth multiplayer experience.

### 5. **Discord Integration**

- **Implemented:** Discord OAuth2 and event notification logic. Game events (rare drops, deaths, trades) trigger Discord notifications.
- **Missing:** Full Discord Activities integration for launching/joining games from Discord.

---

## **Next Most Impactful Step**

**Upgrade movement synchronization to be OSRS-authentic, server-authoritative, and anti-cheat.**

- The ECS `MovementSystem` and `Movement` component are present and support velocity, speed, and target position.
- The current movement handler in `GameRoom.ts` sets player position directly, which is insecure and not OSRS-accurate.

---

### **Next Action:**

**Refactor the movement handler in `GameRoom.ts` to:**

- Accept movement intent (target position), not raw position.
- Validate and update ECS movement component (target, speed).
- Enforce OSRS movement speed and collision.
- Broadcast only validated, server-authoritative positions.

**I will now implement this refactored movement handler in `GameRoom.ts`.**

```

```

The movement handler in `GameRoom.ts` is now refactored to be server-authoritative and OSRS-authentic:

- It accepts a movement intent (target position), validates map bounds and collision, and enforces OSRS movement speed (1 tile per 0.6s).
- It updates the ECS movement component for the player, not just the raw position.
- It provides error messages for invalid moves and logs all movement requests.

**Next step:**

- Validate this new movement logic with integration/unit tests for movement validation, anti-cheat, and multiplayer sync.
- Optionally, address the CRLF lint errors (these are not functional errors, but line ending style).

Would you like to proceed with automated tests for this movement system, or address another gameplay system next?

_**Assistant**_

Integration tests for multiplayer movement, OSRS speed, anti-cheat, and collision are now scaffolded in `multiplayer-movement.test.ts`. These tests cover:

- Synchronization between players
- OSRS movement speed enforcement
- Collision and out-of-bounds rejection

**Next steps:**

- Implement the test helpers (`createTestRoom`, `getPlayerPosition`) to enable real test execution.
- Run and validate these tests to ensure the new movement system is robust and OSRS-authentic.

Would you like to proceed with implementing these test helpers, or focus on another gameplay system or feature?
