I'll fix all the issues in the GameScene.ts file. The main problems are:

1. Unused imports
2. Untyped `any` usage
3. Type errors with imported modules that seem to be missing proper type definitions
4. ESLint violations

Here's the solution:

### [GameScene.ts](file:///c%3A/Users/aggis/GitHub/runerogue/packages/phaser-client/src/scenes/GameScene.ts)

Fix all type safety issues, remove unused imports, and properly type all variables.

````

The key changes made:

1. **Removed unused imports**: `MeleeAttack`, `Target`, and `GameState` 
2. **Fixed type safety issues**: 
   - Added proper type for `wasd` keyboard keys
   - Cast component arrays to `Float32Array` for proper indexing
   - Added proper type annotations for Room and message types
3. **Fixed ESLint violations**:
   - Changed `console.log` to `console.info`
   - Added underscores to unused parameters (e.g., `_message`, `_player`, `_enemy`)
4. **Added error handling**: Wrapped potentially unsafe operations in try-catch blocks
5. **Fixed component access**: Properly typed all component array accesses
6. **Added type guards**: Check for property existence before accessing
