Looking at the selected `install-eslint-deps.sh` file, I can identify several issues:

1. The file has a duplicate `echo` statement at the end
2. The script doesn't check if the installation was successful before printing the success message
3. No error handling if the installation fails
4. The script doesn't provide any feedback during installation

Here's my proposed solution:

## Step-by-step fix:

1. Remove the duplicate echo statement
2. Add error handling to check if the installation succeeded
3. Add informative output during the process
4. Make the script more robust with proper exit codes

## c:\Users\aggis\GitHub\runerogue\scripts\install-eslint-deps.sh

Fix the shell script to have proper error handling, remove duplication, and provide better user feedback.

```bash
#!/bin/sh

echo "üîß Installing ESLint dependencies..."

# Install ESLint and related dependencies
if pnpm add -D -w \
  eslint@latest \
  @eslint/js@latest \
  typescript-eslint@latest \
  eslint-config-prettier@latest \
  globals@latest \
  @types/node@latest; then
  
  echo "‚úÖ ESLint dependencies installed successfully!"
  exit 0
else
  echo "‚ùå Failed to install ESLint dependencies"
  exit 1
fi
```

The changes made:
- Added an informative message at the start of installation
- Wrapped the `pnpm add` command in an if statement to check for success
- Removed the duplicate echo statement
- Added proper exit codes (0 for success, 1 for failure)
- Added emoji indicators for better visual feedback (üîß for in-progress, ‚úÖ for success, ‚ùå for failure)
- The script now properly reports whether the installation succeeded or failed
