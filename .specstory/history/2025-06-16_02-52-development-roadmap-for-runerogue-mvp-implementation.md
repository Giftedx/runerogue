_**Assistant**_

I'll analyze the RuneRogue codebase comprehensively to determine its current state and create a development roadmap.

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ Working Components

1. **OSRS Data Pipeline (packages/osrs-data)**

   - Combat formulas implemented
   - Express API serving data
   - Equipment and item data structures

2. **Game Server Infrastructure (packages/game-server)**

   - Colyseus room setup
   - Basic schemas defined
   - Server architecture in place

3. **Server Implementation (packages/server)**

   - ECS systems and components
   - Game logic structure
   - Integration with Colyseus

4. **Shared Types (packages/shared)**
   - Common type definitions
   - Utility functions

### ❌ Critical Issues

1. **Test Suite Failing**

   - 27 passing, 79 failing tests
   - Many tests reference missing dependencies
   - Legacy/archived tests need cleanup

2. **Client-Server Disconnection**

   - Phaser client has multiple demo implementations but unclear which works
   - No clear connection between clients and multiplayer server
   - Godot client exists but integration status unknown

3. **Missing Core Features**
   - Player movement not fully implemented
   - Combat system not connected end-to-end
   - No multiplayer synchronization working

## Priority Areas (Vital for MVP)

### 🔴 Priority 1: Fix Test Infrastructure

- Clean up or remove failing legacy tests
- Ensure core packages have working test coverage
- Establish baseline for development

### 🔴 Priority 2: Client-Server Integration

# RuneRogue Development Task: MVP Implementation

You are tasked with implementing the core multiplayer functionality for RuneRogue, an OSRS-inspired multiplayer roguelike game. The codebase has the foundation but needs critical integration work.

## Current State

- OSRS data pipeline: ✅ Working (packages/osrs-data)
- Game server: ✅ Structure exists (packages/game-server, packages/server)
- Clients: ❌ Not connected to server (packages/phaser-client, client/godot)
- Tests: ⚠️ 27 passing, 79 failing (mostly legacy)

## Your Tasks (in order)

### 1. Fix Test Infrastructure (CRITICAL)

```bash
# First, assess the test situation
pnpm test --listTests

# Focus on core packages
cd packages/osrs-data && pnpm test
cd packages/game-server && pnpm test
cd packages/server && pnpm test
```

**Actions:**

- Remove or fix tests in `archived-tests-legacy/` and `archived-tests-debug/`
- Ensure core package tests pass
- Update jest configs if needed
- Goal: Green test suite for active packages

### 2. Connect Phaser Client to Server

**Analyze existing implementations:**

- `packages/phaser-client/public/working-client.html`
- `packages/phaser-client/public/enhanced-client.html`
- `packages/phaser-client/public/test-client.html`

**Implement:**

```typescript
// In packages/phaser-client/src/scenes/GameScene.ts
import * as Colyseus from "colyseus.js";

export class GameScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  private client: Colyseus.Client;
  private room: Colyseus.Room;

  async create() {
    // Connect to game server
    this.client = new Colyseus.Client("ws://localhost:2567");

    try {
      this.room = await this.client.joinOrCreate("game_room", {
        playerName: "Player1",
      });

      // Listen for state changes
      this.room.state.players.onAdd = (player, key) => {
        this.addPlayer(key, player);
      };

      this.room.state.players.onRemove = (player, key) => {
        this.removePlayer(key);
      };

      // Send player input
      this.input.on("pointermove", (pointer) => {
        this.room.send("move", {
          x: pointer.worldX,
          y: pointer.worldY,
        });
      });
    } catch (e) {
      console.error("Failed to join room:", e);
    }
  }
}
```
````

### 3. Implement Server-Side Player Movement

```typescript
// In packages/game-server/src/rooms/GameRoom.ts
import { Room, Client } from "colyseus";
import { GameState } from "../schemas/GameState";

export class GameRoom extends Room<GameState> {
  onCreate(options: any) {
    this.setState(new GameState());

    this.onMessage("move", (client, data) => {
      const player = this.state.players.get(client.sessionId);
      if (player) {
        // Validate movement
        const distance = Math.sqrt(
          Math.pow(data.x - player.x, 2) + Math.pow(data.y - player.y, 2),
        );

        // Prevent teleporting
        if (distance < 100) {
          player.x = data.x;
          player.y = data.y;
        }
      }
    });
  }

  onJoin(client: Client, options: any) {
    const player = new Player();
    player.id = client.sessionId;
    player.name = options.playerName || "Player";
    player.x = Math.random() * 800;
    player.y = Math.random() * 600;

    this.state.players.set(client.sessionId, player);
  }

  onLeave(client: Client) {
    this.state.players.delete(client.sessionId);
  }
}
```

### 4. Create Unified Development Server

```typescript
// Create packages/server/src/index.ts
import express from "express";
import { createServer } from "http";
import { Server } from "colyseus";
import { GameRoom } from "@runerogue/game-server";
import { osrsDataRouter } from "@runerogue/osrs-data";

const app = express();
const gameServer = new Server({
  server: createServer(app),
});

// Register game room
gameServer.define("game_room", GameRoom);

// Serve OSRS data API
app.use("/api/osrs", osrsDataRouter);

// Serve Phaser client
app.use(express.static("../phaser-client/dist"));

gameServer.listen(2567);
console.log("Game server running on ws://localhost:2567");
```

### 5. Add Basic Combat

```typescript
// In packages/server/src/systems/CombatSystem.ts
import { CombatCalculator } from "@runerogue/osrs-data";

export class CombatSystem {
  update(world: World, deltaTime: number) {
    // Query entities with combat components
    const fighters = world.query([CombatComponent, PositionComponent]);

    for (const entity of fighters) {
      const combat = entity.getComponent(CombatComponent);
      const position = entity.getComponent(PositionComponent);

      // Find nearby enemies
      const enemies = this.findEnemiesInRange(
        world,
        position,
        combat.attackRange,
      );

      if (enemies.length > 0 && combat.canAttack()) {
        const target = enemies[0];
        const damage = CombatCalculator.calculateDamage(
          combat.stats,
          target.getComponent(CombatComponent).stats,
        );

        // Apply damage
        target.getComponent(HealthComponent).current -= damage;
        combat.lastAttackTime = Date.now();

        // Broadcast combat event
        this.room.broadcast("combat", {
          attacker: entity.id,
          target: target.id,
          damage: damage,
        });
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 6. Create Development Scripts

```json
// In package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "concurrently \"pnpm dev:server\" \"pnpm dev:client\"",
    "dev:server": "cd packages/server && pnpm dev",
    "dev:client": "cd packages/phaser-client && pnpm dev",
    "test:core": "pnpm test --testPathIgnorePatterns=\"archived\"",
    "clean:tests": "rm -rf packages/*/archived-tests-*"
  }
}
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] All core package tests pass
- [ ] Client connects to server successfully
- [ ] Multiple players can see each other
- [ ] Player movement syncs across clients
- [ ] Basic combat works with OSRS formulas
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] Performance: 60fps with 4 players

## Important Notes

1. **Use existing OSRS data**: Don't recreate formulas, use `@runerogue/osrs-data`
2. **Server authority**: All game logic on server, client just renders
3. **Test incrementally**: Get basic connection working before adding features
4. **Check existing code**: Many systems partially implemented, complete them
5. **Document decisions**: Update README with architecture choices

## Resources

- Colyseus docs: https://docs.colyseus.io/
- OSRS Wiki: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/
- Existing implementations in codebase to reference

Start with test cleanup, then focus on getting one player moving on screen. Build incrementally from there.
