_**Assistant**_

I'll help you fix the architecture instructions file. Looking at the content, I can see that there are placeholder comments for the OSRS combat calculations that need to be implemented with actual formulas. Let me update the file with proper OSRS-authentic combat formulas and more detailed architecture information.

## Solution

I'll enhance the architecture documentation by:
1. Adding actual OSRS combat formulas instead of placeholder comments
2. Expanding the architecture details with more specific implementation patterns
3. Adding proper JSDoc documentation
4. Including more detailed data flow and state management information

### [architecture.instructions.md](file:///c%3A/Users/aggis/GitHub/runerogue/.github/instructions/architecture.instructions.md)

Update the architecture instructions with actual OSRS combat formulas and more detailed implementation patterns.
