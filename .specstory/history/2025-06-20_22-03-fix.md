Looking at the project overview file, I can see there are several formatting issues and duplicated content. Here's a comprehensive fix:

## Step-by-step solution:

1. Remove the duplicated architecture overview and resources sections at the end
2. Fix the markdown formatting issues in the data flow diagram
3. Clean up the code block formatting
4. Remove the dangling code snippets at the very end

# RuneRogue Project Overview

## What is RuneRogue?

RuneRogue is an OSRS-inspired multiplayer roguelike survival game designed as a Discord activity. It combines the authentic combat mechanics of Old School RuneScape with the fast-paced gameplay patterns of Vampire Survivors, creating a unique multiplayer experience.

## Core Concept

- **Genre**: Multiplayer roguelike survival with OSRS mechanics
- **Platform**: Discord Activity (web-based iframe application)
- **Players**: 2-4 players per room
- **Gameplay**: Survive waves of enemies using authentic OSRS combat, prayer, and skill systems
- **Progression**: OSRS-style XP and levels with equipment upgrades

## Technology Stack

### Backend

- **Node.js + TypeScript** - Server runtime with type safety
- **Colyseus** - Real-time multiplayer framework for game rooms
- **Express** - REST API server for OSRS data and static hosting
- **@colyseus/schema** - Efficient state synchronization
- **bitECS** - Entity Component System for game logic

### Frontend (Single Web Client)

- **Phaser 3** - Game rendering engine for 2D graphics
- **React 18** - UI framework for menus, HUD, and Discord integration
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling that matches Discord's design language
- **Vite** - Modern build tool with fast HMR
- **@discord/embedded-app-sdk** - Official Discord integration
- **colyseus.js** - Client-side multiplayer connection
- **Zustand** - State management for UI components

### Data & Storage

- **OSRS Wiki API** - Authentic game data source
- **JSON Files** - Local game data storage
- **Express APIs** - Data access layer
- **PostgreSQL** - Player data persistence (future)
- **Redis** - Session management and caching (future)

### Infrastructure

- **pnpm workspaces** - Monorepo management
- **Jest** - Testing framework
- **Docker** - Containerization (production)
- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD pipeline
