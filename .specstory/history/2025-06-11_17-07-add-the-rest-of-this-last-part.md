Looking at the JSON file, I can see it's missing the closing part after the `"file": ".copilot-pull-request-description-instructions.md"` line. Here's the completion:

### [settings.json](vscode-userdata:/c%3A/Users/aggis/AppData/Roaming/Code%20-%20Insiders/User/profiles/-3b99202c/settings.json)

Add the closing brackets for the pull request description instructions configuration.

```jsonc
// ...existing code...
    "github.copilot.chat.pullRequestDescriptionGeneration.instructions": [
        {
            "file": ".copilot-pull-request-description-instructions.md"
        }
    ]
}
```

The file was missing the closing `}` for the object inside the array and the final closing `}` for the root JSON object.
