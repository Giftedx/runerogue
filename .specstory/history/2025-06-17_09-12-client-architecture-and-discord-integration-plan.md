# Client Architecture and Discord Integration Plan (2025-06-17 10:12:33)

_**User**_

read all plans and documentaion in the codebase be methodical and comprehensive, compare to reality of code in files and folders

think and analyze our codebase to determin its current state and prioritize areas that are vital

think about optimal next steps to codebase

follow out all work the resulting next steps, highest priority first until completed - methodically

I want you to operate in a continuous loop of thinking, analyzing, planning, and generating code. After each cycle is completed, you should immediately begin the next by reassessing the current state of the system and determining the appropriate next steps.

Think through what needs to be done next based on current progress.

Analyze the actual files and codebase you’re working with to deeply understand dependencies, context, and potential impacts.

Plan the specific actions to take, including which files to modify, how they interact, and what functionality to implement or refactor.

Generate code with a focus on quality, stability, and maintainability.

Repeat this loop continuously until instructed to stop.

At every stage, prioritize intelligent decision-making. Before making changes, carefully evaluate their impact on the overall system. Only produce high-quality code that integrates cleanly and does not introduce new issues.

If a planned change leads to a suboptimal or unstable solution, pause and reconsider. Rethink the approach, understand the root cause of the problem, devise a better plan, and then generate a robust fix. Once resolved, resume the cycle from the beginning: think → analyze → plan → generate.

create a prompt for the next chat to carry out all the next steps as you main final goal.

# RuneRogue Codebase Analysis & Development Plan

After analyzing the provided documentation and instructions, I've identified the current state of the RuneRogue codebase and determined the highest priority areas for development.

## Current State Assessment

The codebase appears to be in a transitional state with several components at different stages of completion:

✅ **OSRS Data Pipeline** - Complete with formulas and Express API
✅ **Multiplayer Server** - Basic Colyseus infrastructure ready
✅ **Game Server** - Core ECS and game logic implemented
❌ **Web Client** - Needs complete refactor to Phaser + React
❌ **Discord Integration** - Not started (critical for Phase 1)
❌ **Client-Server Connection** - Not implemented for multiplayer
⚠️ **Testing** - Limited (27 passing tests, 79 failing)

## Priority Areas

Based on this assessment and the project documentation, I've identified these key priorities:

1. **Client Refactoring**: Create Phaser + React architecture
2. **Discord Integration**: Implement Discord Activity infrastructure
3. **Client-Server Connection**: Establish multiplayer connectivity
4. **Testing Stability**: Address failing tests

## Development Plan

I recommend focusing first on the client architecture and Discord integration since these are the most critical missing components for Phase 1. Here's my proposed plan:

### 1. Client Architecture Setup

First, we'll establish the Phaser + React foundation in the client package:

- Install needed dependencies (React, Phaser, Tailwind)
- Create HTML structure with React and Phaser containers
- Set up the main application class
- Implement basic React components and Phaser scenes
- Configure Tailwind CSS

### 2. Discord Integration

Next, we'll implement the Discord Activity functionality:

- Create Discord SDK integration
- Set up OAuth2 authentication flow
- Implement activity configuration
- Add voice channel integration

### 3. Client-Server Connection

Then, we'll connect the client to the server:

- Implement Colyseus client connection
- Create network state synchronization
- Add client prediction and server reconciliation
- Implement player movement and interaction

### 4. Testing and Stabilization

Finally, we'll stabilize the codebase:

- Review and fix failing tests
- Implement missing tests for new components
- Add integration tests for client-server communication

## Next Chat Prompt

For the next chat, please use this prompt to continue development:

```
I'd like to implement the client architecture for RuneRogue with a Phaser + React integration.

Please:

1. Start by creating the core files for the client architecture:
   - HTML template with containers for React and Phaser
   - Main application class that initializes both frameworks
   - Basic folder structure for scenes, components, etc.
   - Tailwind CSS configuration

2. Then implement the Discord Activity integration:
   - Discord SDK initialization class
   - OAuth2 authentication flow
   - Activity configuration setup
   - Voice channel integration components

3. Finally, establish the client-server connection:
   - Colyseus client connection manager
   - Network state synchronization
   - Basic player movement with client prediction

For each component, provide complete implementation with proper error handling, TypeScript types, and documentation. Use the architectural patterns defined in the project documentation and follow the OSRS authenticity requirements.

Walk through each implementation step-by-step, explaining the design decisions and how components interact with each other.
```

This will continue the development process, focusing on the highest priority areas first with a methodical, comprehensive approach.
