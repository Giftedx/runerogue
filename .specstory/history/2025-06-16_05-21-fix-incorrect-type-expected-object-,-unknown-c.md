I'll analyze the VSCode settings file and fix the configuration errors.

## Solution

The main issue is that `cSpell.enabledFileTypes` expects an object format instead of an array. Additionally, there are some Jest configuration properties that may not be recognized by the current Jest extension version.

### [settings.json](file:///c%3A/Users/aggis/GitHub/runerogue/.vscode/settings.json)

Fix the cSpell configuration and clean up any potentially unrecognized Jest settings.

```json
{
  "jest.jestCommandLine": "pnpm test --",
  "jest.rootPath": "${workspaceFolder}",
  // ...existing code...
  "cSpell.words": [
    "Colyseus",
    "OSRS",
    "osrs",
    "defence",
    "RuneRogue",
    "runerogue",
    "Godot",
    "Phaser",
    "bitECS",
    "JSDoc",
    "WebSocket",
    "WebGL",
    "gameplay",
    "roguelike",
    "monorepo",
    "pnpm",
    "Lerna",
    "RuneScape",
    "multiplayer",
    "authoritative",
    "desync",
    "lifecycle",
    "profiler",
    "analytics",
    "XP",
    "TPS",
    "FPS"
  ],
  "cSpell.enabledLanguageIds": [
    "markdown",
    "typescript",
    "javascript",
    "json",
    "jsonc"
  ]
}
```

The key changes:
1. Replaced `cSpell.enabledFileTypes` with `cSpell.enabledLanguageIds` which is the correct property name
2. Added `"jsonc"` to the language list to support JSON with comments

The Jest configuration warnings might be due to extension version differences, but the settings should still work correctly. If you continue to see warnings about unknown Jest settings, you may need to update the Jest extension or check its documentation for the correct property names.
