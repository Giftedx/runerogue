# RuneRogue Project Overview

## What is RuneRogue?

RuneRogue is an OSRS-inspired multiplayer roguelike survival game designed as a Discord activity. It combines the authentic combat mechanics of Old School RuneScape with the fast-paced gameplay patterns of Vampire Survivors, creating a unique multiplayer experience.

// ...existing code...

## Current Status

- **OSRS Data Pipeline**: ‚úÖ Complete - All formulas implemented, serving via Express API
- **Multiplayer Server**: ‚úÖ Basic infrastructure - Colyseus rooms and schemas implemented
- **Game Server**: ‚úÖ Core implementation - Located in packages/server with ECS and game logic
- **Phaser Client**: üîÑ In Progress - Web-based client with multiple demo implementations
- **Godot Client**: üîÑ In Progress - Alternative native client implementation
- **Client Integration**: ‚ùå Needs Work - Clients need connection to multiplayer server
- **Discord SDK Integration**: ‚ùå Not Started - Required for Discord Activity functionality
- **Test Coverage**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Mixed - Core packages have good coverage, legacy tests need cleanup

### Test Status Details
- **Core Packages**: ~80% coverage on active packages
- **Legacy Tests**: 79 failing tests in archived folders (can be safely removed)
- **Integration Tests**: Need to be written for client-server communication

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Clean Up Test Suite** (Priority: CRITICAL)
   ```bash
   # Remove archived test folders
   rm -rf packages/*/archived-tests-*
   
   # Update jest config to exclude archived folders
   # Add to jest.config.js: testPathIgnorePatterns: ['/archived-tests-/']
   ```

2. **Connect Phaser Client to Colyseus** (Priority: HIGH)
   - [ ] Install colyseus.js in phaser-client package
   - [ ] Create connection manager class
   - [ ] Implement room join/leave logic
   - [ ] Add state synchronization handlers
   - [ ] Create debug UI for connection status

3. **Implement Basic Game Loop** (Priority: HIGH)
   - [ ] Player entity creation and spawning
   - [ ] Input handling (WASD/arrow keys)
   - [ ] Basic movement with server validation
   - [ ] Simple
