_**Assistant**_

Looking at the `test.instructions.md` file, I can see several issues that need to be fixed:

1. **Incomplete/truncated code blocks** - Several functions have incomplete implementations with `â€¦` placeholders
2. **Missing implementations** - Some functions are referenced but not fully implemented
3. **Inconsistent error handling** - Some examples don't follow the established patterns
4. **Missing type definitions** - Some interfaces and types are used but not defined

Here's my proposed fix:

## Solution

The main issues are incomplete implementations and missing type definitions throughout the document. I'll fix these by providing complete, production-ready implementations that follow the established patterns.

### [test.instructions.md](file:///c%3A/Users/aggis/GitHub/runerogue/.github/instructions/test.instructions.md)

Fix incomplete implementations, add missing type definitions, and ensure all code examples are complete and follow the established patterns.

# RuneRogue Core Development Instructions

## OSRS Authenticity Requirements

**CRITICAL**: All game mechanics must exactly match Old School RuneScape. No approximations or shortcuts.

### Combat Calculations

- Use exact OSRS damage formulas from `packages/osrs-data/`
- Attack speed must be precise: 4-tick (2.4s), 5-tick (3.0s), 6-tick (3.6s)
- Combat level calculation must match OSRS Wiki exactly
- Prayer effects and drain rates must be authentic

#### Example OSRS Combat Formula Implementation

```typescript
// Type definitions
interface Player {
  strengthLevel: number;
  strengthBonus: number;
  equipmentStrengthBonus: number;
  attackStyle: AttackStyle;
  prayers: PrayerId[];
}

enum AttackStyle {
