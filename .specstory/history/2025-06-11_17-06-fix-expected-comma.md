/fix Expected comma

_**Assistant**_

I'll fix the JSON syntax error in your VS Code settings file. The issue is with an incomplete entry in the `github.copilot.chat.pullRequestDescriptionGeneration.instructions` array.

## Solution

The problem is on line 308 where there's an empty string `""` that should be removed. This appears to be part of an incomplete array entry that's causing a JSON syntax error.

### [settings.json](vscode-userdata:/c%3A/Users/aggis/AppData/Roaming/Code%20-%20Insiders/User/profiles/-3b99202c/settings.json)

Remove the incomplete empty string entry to fix the JSON syntax error.

```jsonc
// ...existing code...
    "github.copilot.chat.pullRequestDescriptionGeneration.instructions": [
        {
            "file": ".copilot-pull-request-description-instructions.md"
        }
    ]
}
```

The fix removes the trailing empty string `""` after the file path, which was causing the JSON parser to expect a comma. The corrected structure properly closes the object within the array.
