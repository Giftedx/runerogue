Looking at the code in `test.instructions.md`, I can identify several issues that need to be fixed:

1. **Missing imports in examples** - Many TypeScript examples reference types/functions that aren't imported
2. **Undefined variables** - Some examples use variables that aren't defined (e.g., `Health` in the performance test)
3. **Type mismatches** - The bitECS example has issues with the `World` type interface
4. **Mock implementations** - Some examples have incomplete mock implementations that could be confusing

Here's my proposed solution to fix these issues:

### [test.instructions.md](file:///c%3A/Users/aggis/GitHub/runerogue/.github/instructions/test.instructions.md)

Fix missing imports, undefined variables, and type issues in the code examples to make them more complete and error-free.

# RuneRogue Core Development Instructions

## OSRS Authenticity Requirements

**CRITICAL**: All game mechanics must exactly match Old School RuneScape. No approximations or shortcuts.

### Combat Calculations

- Use exact OSRS damage formulas from `packages/osrs-data/`
- Attack speed must be precise: 4-tick (2.4s), 5-tick (3.0s), 6-tick (3.6s)
- Combat level calculation must match OSRS Wiki exactly
- Prayer effects and drain rates must be authentic

#### Example OSRS Combat Formula Implementation

```typescript
// Type definitions
interface Player {
  strengthLevel: number;
  strengthBonus: number;
  equipmentStrengthBonus: number;
  attackStyle: AttackStyle;
  prayers
