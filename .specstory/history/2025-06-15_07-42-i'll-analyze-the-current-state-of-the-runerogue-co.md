# I'll analyze the current state of the RuneRogue co (2025-06-15 08:42:40)

_**User**_

I'll analyze the current state of the RuneRogue codebase to determine what needs to be implemented next, following the comprehensive development instructions provided.

Let me start by examining the current project status and comparing it against the development phases outlined in the documentation.

```typescript
/**
 * Analyzes the current RuneRogue project state to determine next implementation priorities
 * @returns Priority-ordered list of implementation tasks
 */
```

Let me examine the current packages and their completion status:

Now let me check the client implementation status:

Let me check the server implementation and see what ECS systems are currently functional:

Based on my analysis of the codebase against the project documentation and development phases, here's what needs to be implemented next:

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current Status Assessment**

### âœ… **Phase 0: Foundation - COMPLETE**

- OSRS data pipeline with combat formulas âœ…
- Colyseus multiplayer server infrastructure âœ…
- bitECS entity component system âœ…
- Comprehensive test suite âœ…
- API server with OSRS data endpoints âœ…

### ðŸ”„ **Phase 1: Multiplayer Prototype - IN PROGRESS**

## ðŸš€ **HIGHEST PRIORITY: Next Implementation Tasks**

### **1. CRITICAL: Complete Client-Server Integration**

The client exists but lacks proper game integration. We need:

```typescript
/**
 * Main game client that connects to Colyseus server and manages game state
 * Implements client-side prediction and server reconciliation
 */
export class GameClient {
  private room: Room<GameRoomState> | null = null;
  private gameEngine: PhaserGame;
  private lastServerState: GameRoomState | null = null;

  /**
   * Initialize connection to game server
   * @param roomId - Optional room ID to join specific room
   */
  async connect(roomId?: string): Promise<void> {
    try {
      const client = new Client("ws://localhost:2567");
      this.room = await client.joinOrCreate<GameRoomState>("game_room", {
        roomId,
      });

      this.setupEventHandlers();
      this.startClientPrediction();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Failed to connect to game server:", error);
      throw new Error("Connection failed");
    }
  }

  /**
   * Handle server state updates with client-side prediction
   */
  private setupEventHandlers(): void {
    if (!this.room) return;

    // Handle state updates
    this.room.onStateChange((state) => {
      this.reconcileServerState(state);
      this.updateGameWorld(state);
    });

    // Handle player join/leave
    this.room.state.players.onAdd = (player, key) => {
      this.createPlayerEntity(player, key);
    };

    this.room.state.players.onRemove = (player, key) => {
      this.removePlayerEntity(key);
    };
  }
}
```

### **2. CRITICAL: Phaser Game Engine Integration**

```typescript
/**
 * Phaser 3 game engine configuration for RuneRogue
 * Handles rendering, input, and client-side game logic
 */
export class PhaserGame extends Phaser.Game {
  constructor() {
    super({
      type: Phaser.AUTO,
      width: 1024,
      height: 768,
      parent: "game-container",
      physics: {
        default: "arcade",
        arcade: {
          gravity: { y: 0 },
          debug: false,
        },
      },
      scene: [BootScene, GameScene, UIScene],
    });
  }
}

/**
 * Main game scene that renders the game world
 */
export class GameScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  private players: Map<string, PlayerSprite> = new Map();
  private enemies: Map<number, EnemySprite> = new Map();
  private gameClient: GameClient;

  constructor() {
    super({ key: "GameScene" });
  }

  /**
   * Update game objects based on server state
   * Implements smooth interpolation between server updates
   */
  updateFromServerState(state: GameRoomState): void {
    // Update player positions with interpolation
    state.players.forEach((serverPlayer, playerId) => {
      const playerSprite = this.players.get(playerId);
      if (playerSprite) {
        playerSprite.interpolateToPosition(
          serverPlayer.position.x,
          serverPlayer.position.y,
        );
        playerSprite.updateHealthBar(serverPlayer.health);
        playerSprite.updatePrayerBar(serverPlayer.prayer);
      }
    });

    // Update enemies
    state.enemies.forEach((serverEnemy, enemyId) => {
      let enemySprite = this.enemies.get(enemyId);
      if (!enemySprite) {
        enemySprite = this.createEnemySprite(serverEnemy);
        this.enemies.set(enemyId, enemySprite);
      }
      enemySprite.updateFromServerData(serverEnemy);
    });
  }
}
```

### **3. HIGH PRIORITY: Player Movement System**

```typescript
/**
 * Handles player movement with server-side validation
 * Implements pathfinding and collision detection
 */
export const MovementSystem = defineSystem((world: World) => {
  const entities = enterQuery(world);
  const deltaTime = 1 / 20; // 20 TPS server tick rate

  for (let i = 0; i < entities.length; i++) {
    const eid = entities[i];

    // Validate movement speed (anti-cheat)
    const currentSpeed = calculateMovementSpeed(eid);
    const maxAllowedSpeed = getMaxMovementSpeed(eid);

    if (currentSpeed > maxAllowedSpeed * 1.1) {
      // 10% tolerance for network lag
      console.warn(
        `Player ${eid} exceeded max speed: ${currentSpeed} > ${maxAllowedSpeed}`,
      );
      // Reset to last valid position
      resetToLastValidPosition(eid);
      continue;
    }

    // Update position
    const velocity = Velocity[eid];
    const position = Position[eid];

    position.x += velocity.x * deltaTime;
    position.y += velocity.y * deltaTime;

    // Collision detection with world boundaries
    validateWorldBounds(eid);

    // Update last valid position for anti-cheat
    updateLastValidPosition(eid);
  }
});
```

### **4. HIGH PRIORITY: Real-time Combat Visualization**

```typescript
/**
 * Renders combat effects and damage numbers
 * Synchronizes with server-authoritative combat results
 */
export class CombatRenderer {
  private scene: Phaser.Scene;
  private damageNumbers: Phaser.GameObjects.Group;
  private hitEffects: Phaser.GameObjects.Group;

  /**
   * Display damage number with OSRS-style formatting
   * @param damage - Damage amount from server
   * @param position - World position to display damage
   * @param damageType - Type of damage (melee, ranged, magic)
   */
  showDamageNumber(
    damage: number,
    position: Vector2,
    damageType: DamageType,
  ): void {
    const color = this.getDamageColor(damageType);
    const damageText = this.scene.add.text(
      position.x,
      position.y,
      damage.toString(),
      {
        fontSize: "16px",
        color: color,
        stroke: "#000000",
        strokeThickness: 2,
        fontFamily: "RuneScape UF",
      },
    );

    // Animate damage number floating upward
    this.scene.tweens.add({
      targets: damageText,
      y: position.y - 50,
      alpha: 0,
      duration: 1500,
      ease: "Power2",
      onComplete: () => damageText.destroy(),
    });
  }

  /**
   * Play hit effect animation
   */
  playHitEffect(target: Vector2, attackType: AttackType): void {
    const effect = this.scene.add.sprite(
      target.x,
      target.y,
      `${attackType}_hit_effect`,
    );
    effect.play(`${attackType}_hit_animation`);
    effect.once("animationcomplete", () => effect.destroy());
  }
}
```

### **5. MEDIUM PRIORITY: Discord Activity Integration**

```typescript
/**
 * Discord Activity SDK integration for RuneRogue
 * Handles authentication, voice, and social features
 */
export class DiscordActivitySDK {
  private discordSdk: DiscordSDK;
  private auth: DiscordAuth | null = null;

  /**
   * Initialize Discord Activity
   */
  async initialize(): Promise<void> {
    this.discordSdk = new DiscordSDK(process.env.DISCORD_CLIENT_ID!);

    // Wait for Discord to be ready
    await this.discordSdk.ready();

    // Authenticate user
    this.auth = await this.discordSdk.commands.authenticate({
      access_token: await this.getAccessToken(),
    });

    // Set activity status
    await this.setActivity("Playing RuneRogue", "In multiplayer survival");
  }

  /**
   * Get user's Discord info for display in game
   */
  getUserInfo(): DiscordUser | null {
    return this.auth?.user || null;
  }

  /**
   * Update Discord activity status
   */
  async setActivity(details: string, state: string): Promise<void> {
    await this.discordSdk.commands.setActivity({
      activity: {
        details,
        state,
        timestamps: {
          start: Date.now(),
        },
        assets: {
          large_image: "runerogue_logo",
          large_text: "RuneRogue",
        },
      },
    });
  }
}
```

## ðŸ“‹ **Implementation Priority Order**

### **ðŸ”´ CRITICAL (This Week)**

1. **Client-Server Integration** - Connect Phaser client to Colyseus server
2. **Player Movement** - Real-time movement with server validation
3. **Basic Combat Rendering** - Visualize damage and effects

### **ðŸŸ¡ HIGH (Next Week)**

4. **Enemy Spawning System** - Server-controlled enemy generation
5. **UI Health/Prayer Bars** - Real-time stat display
6. **Discord Activity Setup** - Basic activity integration

### **ðŸŸ¢ MEDIUM (Following Weeks)**

7. **Advanced Combat Effects** - Particle systems and animations
8. **Sound System** - OSRS-authentic audio
9. **Performance Optimization** - 60fps with 4 players + enemies

## ðŸ›  **Technical Implementation Strategy**

### **Start with MVP Client-Server Connection**

```bash
# Create basic client entry point
cd client/src
mkdir game combat discord
touch game/GameClient.ts game/PhaserGame.ts

# Test connection
pnpm dev
# Verify client can connect to server and join room
```

### **Follow OSRS Authenticity Guidelines**

- Use exact combat formulas from osrs-data
- Implement precise tick timing (20 TPS server, 60 FPS client)
- Validate all mechanics against OSRS Wiki

### **Implement Client-Side Prediction**

- Predict movement locally for responsiveness
- Reconcile with server state on updates
- Handle network lag gracefully

This analysis shows we need to focus on **client-server integration** as the highest priority, as it's the foundation for all other multiplayer features. The ECS backend is solid, but the client needs to be connected to make the game playable.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status Assessment

- **Phase 0: Foundation** â€“ Complete (OSRS data, ECS, Colyseus, API, tests)
- **Phase 1: Multiplayer Prototype** â€“ In Progress

---

## ðŸš€ Highest Priority: Next Implementation Tasks

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL (This Week)

1. **Client-Server Integration**

   - Connect Phaser client to Colyseus server.
   - Implement `GameClient` class for connection, state sync, and event handling.
   - Add client-side prediction and server reconciliation.

2. **Player Movement System**

   - Implement real-time movement with server-side validation.

8. Sound system (OSRS-authentic audio)
9. Performance optimization (target 60fps, 4+ players)

---

## ðŸ›  Technical Implementation Strategy

- **Start with MVP Client-Server Connection:**  
  Create `GameClient.ts` and `PhaserGame.ts` in `client/src/game/`.  
  Test connection and state sync with Colyseus.

- **Follow OSRS Authenticity Guidelines:**  
  Use formulas from `osrs-data`, validate all mechanics, and match tick timing.

- **Implement Client-Side Prediction:**  
  Predict movement locally, reconcile with server, and handle lag gracefully.

- **Write Unit and Integration Tests:**  
  Ensure 95%+ coverage, especially for movement and combat logic.

---

## Example Next Steps

1. Scaffold `GameClient` and `PhaserGame` classes in the client.
2. Implement Colyseus connection and event handlers.
3. Add ECS-driven movement system with anti-cheat.
4. Render player/enemy positions and combat effects in Phaser.
5. Write tests for movement, state sync, and combat rendering.

---

**Summary:**  
Focus on connecting the client to the server, implementing real-time movement with server validation, and visualizing combat. This will make the game playable and unlock further multiplayer features. All work should follow strict OSRS authenticity, TypeScript safety, and testing standards.

continue agentically

---

_**Assistant**_

- Scaffolded the core client-side multiplayer architecture: `GameClient`, `PhaserGame`, and main Phaser scenes (`BootScene`, `GameScene`, `UIScene`), following all project and OSRS authenticity standards.
- Added unit tests for `GameClient` connection logic.
- Next steps: implement client-side prediction, server reconciliation, and real-time movement/combat rendering. All code is ready for further feature development and test-driven iteration.

---

_**User**_

continue agentically

---

_**Assistant**_

```

```

```

```

```

```

- Added real-time movement input handling to `GameScene` and a `sendMoveCommand` method to `GameClient`, enabling client-to-server movement commands.
- Wired up `PhaserGame` to set the `GameClient` instance on the scene, so input can trigger networked movement.
- This establishes the foundation for OSRS-authentic, server-authoritative player movement with client-side prediction and reconciliation.

Next: implement prediction logic, server reconciliation, and expand input to support OSRS-style click-to-move and pathfinding. Let me know if you want to proceed with those features or need a demo integration entry point.

- Added OSRS-authentic click-to-move support in `GameScene`, sending world coordinates to the server on mouse click.
- Retained WASD/arrow movement for development and debugging.
- This enables both authentic and developer-friendly movement input, ready for server-side pathfinding and validation.

Next steps: implement client-side prediction and reconciliation, and ensure server-side ECS movement system matches OSRS tick timing and anti-cheat requirements. Let me know if you want to proceed with prediction logic or server-side movement next.

I want you to operate in a continuous loop of thinking, analyzing, planning, and generating code. After each cycle is completed, you should immediately begin the next by reassessing the current state of the system and determining the appropriate next steps.

Think through what needs to be done next based on current progress.

Analyze the actual files and codebase youâ€™re working with to deeply understand dependencies, context, and potential impacts.

Plan the specific actions to take, including which files to modify, how they interact, and what functionality to implement or refactor.

Generate code with a focus on quality, stability, and maintainability.

Repeat this loop continuously until instructed to stop.

At every stage, prioritize intelligent decision-making. Before making changes, carefully evaluate their impact on the overall system. Only produce high-quality code that integrates cleanly and does not introduce new issues.

If a planned change leads to a suboptimal or unstable solution, pause and reconsider. Rethink the approach, understand the root cause of the problem, devise a better plan, and then generate a robust fix. Once resolved, resume the cycle from the beginning: think â†’ analyze â†’ plan â†’ generate.

- Exposed the local player ID in `GameClient` for use in prediction and reconciliation.
- Implemented a prediction buffer and interpolation logic in `GameScene`:
  - Local player movement is predicted immediately on input.
  - When server state arrives, the sprite interpolates smoothly toward the authoritative position, correcting any drift.
  - Buffer is pruned as server updates confirm predicted positions.

This enables responsive, OSRS-authentic movement with client-side prediction and smooth correction, even under network latency. Next, I will reassess the system and plan further improvements or features.

- Added strict type annotations, robust error handling, and comprehensive JSDoc comments to `GameScene`.
- All movement prediction and interpolation logic is now type-safe and maintainable.
- The interface between `GameClient` and `GameScene` is explicit and robust.

Next, I will plan and implement unit tests for the prediction/interpolation logic, and then proceed to the next highest-priority gameplay or infrastructure feature.

- Added comprehensive unit tests for `GameScene` covering movement prediction, interpolation, buffer pruning, and error handling, using mocks for Phaser and GameClient.
- This ensures the movement system is robust, correct, and maintainable.

Next, I will reassess the system and plan the next high-impact improvementâ€”such as real-time combat visualization, server-side anti-cheat, or further UI/UX enhancements.
