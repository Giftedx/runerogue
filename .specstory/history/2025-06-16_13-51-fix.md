_**Assistant**_

Looking at the code in `core-standards.instructions.md`, I can see several issues that need to be fixed:

1. **Incomplete combat formula** - The attack style bonus is incorrectly applied (should check for aggressive, not slash)
2. **Missing prayer constants** - Referenced prayers like "piety" aren't defined
3. **Incomplete test data** - Test cases have incomplete CombatStats objects
4. **Missing imports in test example** - The test imports from "../combat" which doesn't exist in this file

Here's my proposed fix:

## Solution

I'll fix the issues in the core-standards.instructions.md file by:

1. Correcting the combat calculations to match OSRS formulas
2. Adding missing prayer definitions
3. Completing the test examples with proper data
4. Fixing import references

### [core-standards.instructions.md](file:///c%3A/Users/aggis/GitHub/runerogue/.github/instructions/core-standards.instructions.md)

Fix combat calculations, add missing prayer definitions, and complete test examples.

# RuneRogue Core Development Instructions

## OSRS Authenticity Requirements

**CRITICAL**: All game mechanics must exactly match Old School RuneScape. No approximations or shortcuts.

### Combat Calculations

- Use exact OSRS damage formulas from `packages/osrs-data/`
- Attack speed must be precise: 4-tick (2.4s), 5-tick (3.0s), 6-tick (3.6s)
- Combat level calculation must match OSRS Wiki exactly
- Prayer effects and drain rates must be authentic

#### Example Validation

```typescript
// Import from actual packages when available
// For now, use type imports to avoid runtime errors
import type { CombatStats, PlayerStats } from "@runerogue/shared";

// Example validation against known OSRS values
function validateCombatCalculation(playerStats: PlayerStats): boolean {
  const expectedMaxHit = 15; // From OSRS Wiki for specific gear
  const calculatedMaxHit = calculateMaxHit(playerStats);
  return calculatedMaxHit === expectedMaxHit;
}

// Placeholder for actual implementation
function calculateMaxHit(stats: PlayerStats): number {
  // Implementation should use OSRS formulas from packages/osrs-data
  return 0;
}
```

### Data Validation

- Cross-reference all stats with OSRS Wiki
- Use existing OSRS data pipeline for validation
- Test calculations against known OSRS values
- Document Wiki sources in code comments

### OSRS Game Constants

```typescript
// OSRS movement speeds (tiles per game tick)
export const OSRS_WALK_SPEED = 1; // 1 tile per tick when walking
export const OSRS_RUN_SPEED = 2; // 2 tiles per tick when running

// OSRS tick rate
export const OSRS_TICK_MS = 600; // 0.6 seconds per game tick

// Combat ticks
export const WEAPON_SPEEDS = {
  FAST: 4, // 2.4 seconds
  AVERAGE: 5, // 3.0 seconds
  SLOW: 6, // 3.6 seconds
} as const;

// Attack styles and their bonuses
export const ATTACK_STYLE_BONUSES = {
  ACCURATE: { attack: 3, strength: 0, defence: 0 },
  AGGRESSIVE: { attack: 0, strength: 3, defence: 0 },
  DEFENSIVE: { attack: 0, strength: 0, defence: 3 },
  CONTROLLED: { attack: 1, strength: 1, defence: 1 },
} as const;

// Prayer bonus multipliers
export const PRAYER_BONUSES = {
  // Attack prayers
  CLARITY_OF_THOUGHT: { attack: 1.05, strength: 1.0, defence: 1.0 },
  IMPROVED_REFLEXES: { attack: 1.1, strength: 1.0, defence: 1.0 },
  INCREDIBLE_REFLEXES: { attack: 1.15, strength: 1.0, defence: 1.0 },

  // Strength prayers
  BURST_OF_STRENGTH: { attack: 1.0, strength: 1.05, defence: 1.0 },
  SUPERHUMAN_STRENGTH: { attack: 1.0, strength: 1.1, defence: 1.0 },
  ULTIMATE_STRENGTH: { attack: 1.0, strength: 1.15, defence: 1.0 },

  // Defence prayers
  THICK_SKIN: { attack: 1.0, strength: 1.0, defence: 1.05 },
  ROCK_SKIN: { attack: 1.0, strength: 1.0, defence: 1.1 },
  STEEL_SKIN: { attack: 1.0, strength: 1.0, defence: 1.15 },

  // Combined prayers
  CHIVALRY: { attack: 1.15, strength: 1.18, defence: 1.2 },
  PIETY: { attack: 1.2, strength: 1.23, defence: 1.25 },
  RIGOUR: { ranged: 1.2, rangedStrength: 1.23, defence: 1.25 },
  AUGURY: { magic: 1.25, defence: 1.25 },
} as const;

// Prayer drain rates (points per minute)
export const PRAYER_DRAIN_RATES = {
  THICK_SKIN: 1,
  BURST_OF_STRENGTH: 1,
  CLARITY_OF_THOUGHT: 1,
  ROCK_SKIN: 2,
  SUPERHUMAN_STRENGTH: 2,
  IMPROVED_REFLEXES: 2,
  RAPID_RESTORE: 0.5,
  RAPID_HEAL: 0.5,
  PROTECT_ITEM: 0.5,
  STEEL_SKIN: 4,
  ULTIMATE_STRENGTH: 4,
  INCREDIBLE_REFLEXES: 4,
  PROTECT_FROM_MAGIC: 4,
  PROTECT_FROM_MISSILES: 4,
  PROTECT_FROM_MELEE: 4,
  CHIVALRY: 24,
  PIETY: 24,
  RIGOUR: 24,
  AUGURY: 24,
} as const;
```

## TypeScript Standards

### Type Safety

- Use strict TypeScript settings, no `any` types
- Define proper interfaces for all game data structures
- Add comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- Implement proper error handling with Result types

#### Enhanced Result Type Pattern

```typescript
export type Result<T, E = Error> =
  | { success: true; value: T }
  | { success: false; error: E };

export type GameError =
  | { type: "INVALID_INPUT"; message: string }
  | { type: "CALCULATION_ERROR"; message: string }
  | { type: "NETWORK_ERROR"; message: string }
