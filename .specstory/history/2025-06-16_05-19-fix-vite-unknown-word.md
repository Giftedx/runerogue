/fix "Vite": Unknown word.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll fix the spelling/unknown word issues in the project overview document.

## Solution

The issue is that "Vite" is being flagged as an unknown word, but it's actually a legitimate build tool name. I'll add a comment to indicate it's a proper noun/tool name.

### [project-overview.instructions.md](file:///c%3A/Users/aggis/GitHub/runerogue/.github/instructions/project-overview.instructions.md)

Fix the unknown word issue by adding a comment to clarify that Vite is a build tool name.
