Looking at the project overview document, I'll propose fixes for the remaining issues in Phase 1 - Week 3. The document shows that enemy spawning, collision detection, and animations are still incomplete. Let me provide a comprehensive solution to complete these critical gameplay features.

## Solution Overview

1. **Fix Enemy Spawning System** - Implement server-side enemy spawning with proper schemas
2. **Add Collision Detection** - Enable Phaser physics for player-enemy interactions
3. **Implement Basic Animations** - Add sprite animations for players and enemies
4. **Integrate OSRS Combat** - Connect the existing OSRS data formulas to gameplay
5. **Add Wave Progression** - Implement a simple wave system

## File Changes

### [GameState.ts](file:///c%3A/Users/aggis/GitHub/runerogue/packages/game-server/src/schemas/GameState.ts)

Update the GameState schema to include enemies and wave information:
