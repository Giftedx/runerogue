Looking at the development workflow document, I can see several areas that need improvement based on the error analysis. The document has some outdated or incorrect information that could cause confusion for developers. Let me propose fixes to make it more accurate and helpful.

## Solution Overview

1. Fix incorrect test command patterns
2. Add missing script commands that are referenced
3. Improve clarity around test execution and current test status
4. Add more specific debugging guidance
5. Include actual working commands based on the project structure

### [development-workflow.instructions.md](file:///c%3A/Users/aggis/GitHub/runerogue/.github/instructions/development-workflow.instructions.md)

Update the development workflow documentation to fix incorrect commands and add missing information.

# RuneRogue Development Workflow

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm package manager
- Git version control

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd runerogue

# Install dependencies using pnpm workspaces
pnpm install

# Set up environment (optional - most packages work without .env)
cp env.template .env

# Start development servers
pnpm dev
```

## Daily Development Process

### 1. Start Development Session

```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Install any new dependencies
pnpm install

# Start all services in parallel
pnpm dev
```

### 2. Run Tests Before Changes

```bash
# Run all tests across workspace
pnpm test

# Run tests for specific packages
pnpm --filter @runerogue/osrs-data test
pnpm --filter @runerogue/game-server test
pnpm --filter @runerogue/server test
pnpm --filter @runerogue/phaser-client test

# Run tests with specific patterns
pnpm test -- combat
pnpm test -- "damage calculation"

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test -- --watch

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test -- --coverage
```

### 3. Make Changes

- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Include JSDoc documentation
- Write unit tests for new features
- Validate OSRS mechanics against Wiki

### 4. Validate Changes

```bash
# Run tests
pnpm test

# Check TypeScript (if script exists)
pnpm type-check || pnpm tsc --noEmit

# Lint code (if configured)
pnpm lint || echo "No lint script configured"

# Format code (if configured)
pnpm format || echo "No format script configured"

# Build packages to check for errors
pnpm build
```

### 5. Commit Changes

```bash
# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: implement player movement system with client prediction"

# Push to feature branch
git push origin feature/player-movement
```

## Branch Strategy

### Main Branches

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - Individual feature development
- `hotfix/*` - Critical bug fixes

### Feature Development

```bash
# Create feature branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/combat-system

# Work on feature
# ... make changes ...

# Push for review
git push -u origin feature/combat-system

# Create pull request
# Review and merge to develop
```

## Code Review Process

### Before Submitting PR

- All relevant tests passing
