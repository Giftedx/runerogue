_**Assistant**_

Looking at the project overview document, I can see several areas that need improvement and clarification. Let me propose fixes for the key problems:

## Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Fix inconsistent commands across platforms** - The document has both Unix/macOS and Windows commands mixed together, which can be confusing
2. **Update outdated Discord SDK version** - The document references an old version (0.0.12) of the Discord Embedded App SDK
3. **Clarify the actual current status** - The status section seems outdated based on the recent test results
4. **Fix environment setup commands** - The commands for creating .env files have syntax issues
5. **Add missing critical setup steps** - Some important steps for Discord Activity development are missing

Update the project overview with clearer instructions, fixed commands, and updated status information.
