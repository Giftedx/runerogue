Looking at the errors in the project overview file, I can see there are several formatting and content issues that need to be fixed. Let me provide a corrected version:

## Solution

The main issues are:
1. Inconsistent formatting in the Discord Application Setup section
2. Missing closing backticks in code blocks
3. Incomplete instructions in some sections
4. Formatting issues with bash commands on different platforms

### [project-overview.instructions.md](file:///c%3A/Users/aggis/GitHub/runerogue/.github/instructions/project-overview.instructions.md)

Fix formatting issues, complete missing sections, and ensure all code blocks are properly closed.

# RuneRogue Project Overview

## What is RuneRogue?

RuneRogue is an OSRS-inspired multiplayer roguelike survival game designed as a Discord activity. It combines the authentic combat mechanics of Old School RuneScape with the fast-paced gameplay patterns of Vampire Survivors, creating a unique multiplayer experience.

## Core Concept

- **Genre**: Multiplayer roguelike survival with OSRS mechanics
- **Platform**: Discord Activity (web-based iframe application)

- **Gameplay**: Survive waves of enemies using authentic OSRS combat, prayer, and skill systems
- **Progression**: OSRS-style XP and levels with equipment upgrades

## Technology Stack

### Backend

- **Node.js + TypeScript** - Server runtime with type safety
- **Colyseus** - Real-time multiplayer framework for game rooms
- **Express** - REST API server for OSRS data and static hosting
- **@colyseus/schema** - Efficient state synchronization
- **bitECS** - Entity Component System for game logic

### Frontend (Single Web Client)

- **Phaser 3** - Game rendering engine for 2D graphics
- **React 18** - UI framework for menus, HUD, and Discord integration
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling that matches Discord's design language
- **Vite** - Modern build tool with fast HMR
- **@discord/embedded-app-sdk** - Official Discord integration
- **colyseus.js** - Client-side multiplayer connection
- **Zustand** - State management for UI components

### Data & Storage

- **OSRS Wiki API** - Authentic game data source
- **JSON Files** - Local game data storage
- **Express APIs** - Data access layer
- **PostgreSQL** - Player data persistence (future)
- **Redis** - Session management and caching (future)

### Infrastructure

- **pnpm workspaces** - Monorepo management
- **Jest** - Testing framework
- **Docker** - Containerization (production)
- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD pipeline
