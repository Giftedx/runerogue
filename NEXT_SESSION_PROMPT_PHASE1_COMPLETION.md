- ‚úÖ Schema definition issues with property initialization
- ‚úÖ TypeScript configuration for experimental decorators
- ‚úÖ Client-server connection stability
- ‚úÖ Environment variables and asset loading issues
- ‚úÖ Discord Activity provider fallbacks

**Working Systems:**

- ‚úÖ Game server running on `ws://localhost:2567`
- ‚úÖ Phaser client running on `http://localhost:3002`
- ‚úÖ SimpleTestRoom with working schema synchronization
- ‚úÖ SchemalessTestRoom as backup (plain object sync)
- ‚úÖ Test clients connecting and functioning properly
- ‚úÖ Player state synchronization (position, health, movement)

## üéØ REMAINING PHASE 1 TASKS

### PRIORITY 1: Enemy Systems Integration (CRITICAL)

**Goal**: Integrate the existing server-side enemy systems with the working schema and client rendering.

#### Server-Side Enemy Integration

1. **Update GameRoom to use SimpleEnemySpawnSystem and SimpleEnemyAISystem**

   - Files: `packages/game-server/src/rooms/GameRoom.ts`
   - Replace complex enemy systems with simplified versions that work
   - Ensure enemy spawning every 5 seconds as currently tested

2. **Add Enemy schema to SimpleTestRoom for testing**

   - Files: `packages/game-server/src/rooms/SimpleTestRoom.ts`
   - Add `SimpleEnemy` schema class following the same pattern as `SimplePlayer`
   - Add enemy state to `SimpleGameState`
   - Test with existing enemy spawn systems

3. **Schema Definition for Enemies**

   ```typescript
   export class SimpleEnemy extends Schema {
     @type("string") id: string = "";
     @type("number") x: number = 0;
     @type("number") y: number = 0;
     @type("number") health: number = 100;
     @type("string") enemyType: string = "goblin";

     constructor() {
       super();
     }
   }
   ```

#### Client-Side Enemy Rendering

1. **Update GameScene to render enemies**

   - Files: `packages/phaser-client/src/scenes/GameScene.ts`
   - Add enemy sprite management similar to player sprites
   - Use existing "enemy_placeholder" texture
   - Add enemy health bars

2. **NetworkManager enemy handlers**
   - Files: `packages/phaser-client/src/network/NetworkManager.ts`
   - Add enemy state change listeners
   - Handle enemy spawn/despawn events

### PRIORITY 2: Combat System Integration

1. **Player-Enemy Collision Detection**

   - Implement collision detection between players and enemies
   - Add collision response (damage dealing)
   - Use OSRS-authentic damage calculations from `packages/osrs-data/`

2. **Combat Event Handling**
   - Server: Emit combat events when collisions occur
   - Client: Display damage splats and animations
   - Update health bars in real-time

### PRIORITY 3: Wave Progression System

1. **Implement Basic Wave System**
   - Start with Wave 1: 3 goblins
   - Wave progression every 30 seconds
   - Increase enemy count and difficulty per wave
   - Add wave UI indicator

### PRIORITY 4: Client-Server State Sync Completion

1. **Update ConnectionTest Component**

   - Files: `packages/phaser-client/src/ui/components/ConnectionTest.tsx`
   - Add enemy count display
   - Add current wave indicator
   - Show real-time combat stats

2. **GameScene Full Integration**
   - Connect to actual "game" room instead of "test" room
   - Implement all game state handlers
   - Add player movement with WASD/arrow keys
   - Add click-to-move functionality

### PRIORITY 5: Polish and Testing

1. **Death and Respawn Mechanics**

   - Player death when health reaches 0
   - Respawn after 5 seconds
   - Reset player position on respawn

2. **Basic Animations**

   - Player movement animations
   - Enemy movement animations
   - Combat hit animations
   - Death animations

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Ensure 60fps with 4 players and 20+ enemies
   - Optimize sprite rendering
   - Optimize network updates

## üìÅ KEY FILES TO WORK WITH

### Server Files (Priority Order)

1. `packages/game-server/src/rooms/SimpleTestRoom.ts` - Add enemy schema
2. `packages/game-server/src/rooms/GameRoom.ts` - Integrate enemy systems
3. `packages/game-server/src/ecs/systems/SimpleEnemySpawnSystem.ts` - Enemy spawning
4. `packages/game-server/src/ecs/systems/SimpleEnemyAISystem.ts` - Enemy AI

### Client Files (Priority Order)

1. `packages/phaser-client/src/scenes/GameScene.ts` - Enemy rendering
2. `packages/phaser-client/src/network/NetworkManager.ts` - Enemy state sync
3. `packages/phaser-client/src/ui/components/ConnectionTest.tsx` - UI updates

### Shared Files

1. `packages/shared/src/types/entities.ts` - Enemy type definitions

## üß™ TESTING STRATEGY

### Testing Approach

1. **Test each enemy system individually** using the working test clients
2. **Use SimpleTestRoom** for isolated enemy testing before integrating with GameRoom
3. **Test with multiple clients** to ensure multiplayer functionality
4. **Verify OSRS-authentic calculations** using `packages/osrs-data/`

### Test Commands (Working)

```bash
# Server
cd packages/game-server && pnpm dev

# Client
cd packages/phaser-client && pnpm dev

# Test schema-based room
node test-simple-client-fixed.js

# Test schema-less room (backup)
node test-schemaless-client.js
```

## üèÜ SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR PHASE 1 COMPLETION

1. **Multiplayer Enemy Combat**: 2-4 players can fight waves of enemies together
2. **OSRS Authentic Mechanics**: Combat calculations match OSRS formulas exactly
3. **Real-time Sync**: All game state syncs smoothly between clients
4. **60fps Performance**: Smooth gameplay with multiple players and enemies
5. **Discord Activity Ready**: Deployable as a Discord Activity
6. **Wave Progression**: At least 5 waves with increasing difficulty

## üîß TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS

### Must Maintain

- **OSRS Authenticity**: All combat mechanics must match OSRS exactly
- **TypeScript Type Safety**: No `any` types, comprehensive error handling
- **Server Authority**: All game logic validated server-side
- **Schema Compatibility**: Use the fixed schema approach consistently

### Performance Targets

- **60fps client rendering** with 4 players + 20 enemies
- **<50ms network latency** for game events
- **16ms frame budget** maximum for client updates

## üìã IMMEDIATE FIRST STEPS FOR NEXT SESSION

1. **Start the working servers** (game-server on 2567, phaser-client on 3002)
2. **Test current functionality** with existing test clients to confirm baseline
3. **Add SimpleEnemy schema** to SimpleTestRoom following the working pattern
4. **Test enemy schema sync** with a modified test client
5. **Begin enemy rendering integration** in GameScene

## üéØ EXPECTED OUTCOME

By the end of the next session, you should have:

- Working enemy spawning and rendering
- Basic player-enemy combat
- Real-time multiplayer enemy synchronization
- Foundation for wave progression system
- **Phase 1 completion within reach**

The critical blocker has been resolved - now it's execution of the remaining gameplay features using the proven, working architecture.

## üö® CRITICAL NOTES

- **Schema Fix**: The schema issue was fixed by using explicit default values and constructors, plus `useDefineForClassFields: false` in TypeScript config
- **Working Pattern**: Follow the `SimplePlayer` schema pattern exactly for `SimpleEnemy`
- **Test Coverage**: Use the working test clients to validate each step
- **Performance**: Monitor fps and network performance throughout development

**Architecture is SOLID. Multiplayer is WORKING. Time to build the game!** üéÆ
