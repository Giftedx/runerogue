<!-- Test for comparing all research MCP approaches -->
## Task Type
- [x] Research - Advanced MCP Comparison Test

## Priority
- [x] High

## Description
**COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH COMPARISON**: Test and compare multiple MCP research approaches for OSRS economy analysis to determine the best tools for different use cases.

## Research Challenge
Conduct the **SAME research task** using different MCP tools to compare their capabilities:

### ðŸŽ¯ **Research Task**: "Current OSRS Economy State - June 2025"

**Research all available tools on this specific query:**

> "Analyze the current state of the Old School RuneScape economy as of June 2025. Focus on:
> 1. Top 10 most valuable items and recent price trends
> 2. Any major market disruptions or events affecting prices
> 3. Player trading activity levels
> 4. Impact of recent game updates on the economy
> 5. Seasonal factors affecting current market conditions"
