#### 5. **Health Monitoring System**
- ✅ **Periodic Health Checks** (configurable intervals)
- ✅ **Comprehensive Health Reports** on shutdown
- ✅ **System Performance Summaries**
- ✅ **Manual Health Check Triggers**

#### 6. **Player Management Integration**
- ✅ **Automatic Player Addition** to ECS on join
- ✅ **Automatic Player Removal** from ECS on leave
- ✅ **Bidirectional State Synchronization** (Colyseus ↔ ECS)
- ✅ **Entity ID Mapping Management**

#### 7. **Graceful Lifecycle Management**
- ✅ **Clean Startup** with validation checks
- ✅ **Graceful Shutdown** with final reports
- ✅ **Resource Cleanup** on disposal
- ✅ **Signal Handling** for process termination

## 🔧 **Architecture Components**

### 1. **ECSAutomationManager Class**
```typescript
// Full automation with configuration
const manager = new ECSAutomationManager({
  targetFrameRate: 60,
  performanceMonitoringEnabled: true,
  autoRecoveryEnabled: true,
  maxErrorsPerSecond: 5,
  healthCheckInterval: 5000
});
```

### 2. **GameRoom Integration**
```typescript
// Automatic startup in onCreate()
this.ecsAutomationManager = new ECSAutomationManager({...});
await this.ecsAutomationManager.start();

// Automatic cleanup in onDispose()
await this.ecsAutomationManager.stop();
```

### 3. **Player Management**
```typescript
// Automatic on join
const entityId = this.ecsAutomationManager.addPlayer(player);

// Automatic on leave  
this.ecsAutomationManager.removePlayer(playerId);
```
