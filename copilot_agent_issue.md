## Task Type
- [x] Feature - Implement a new feature

## Priority
- [x] Medium

## Description
Analyze the current implementation of the OSRS parser in the `economy_models/osrs_parser.py` file. The parser is responsible for extracting data from Old School RuneScape pages, but it might benefit from improvements in error handling, efficiency, and code organization.

Please review the implementation and suggest or implement improvements to:
1. Enhance error handling to be more robust against different HTML structures
2. Improve parsing efficiency where possible
3. Add better documentation and type hints
4. Implement unit tests for any new functionality

## Relevant Code References
- `economy_models/osrs_parser.py` - Main parser implementation
- `test_osrs_parser.py` - Existing test file
- `debug_osrs_page.html` - Sample HTML for testing

## Custom MCP Tool Options

### For Testing Tasks
- Test Path: tests/
- Markers: unit
- Verbose: true

### For Linting Tasks
- File Path: economy_models/osrs_parser.py
- Auto-fix: true

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Improved error handling for parsing edge cases
- [x] Code is properly documented with docstrings and type hints
- [x] Unit tests cover the new functionality
- [x] Performance is improved or at least maintained
- [x] Code passes all linting checks

## Environment
- [x] Development
- Python Version: 3.10+
- Other relevant environment details: Requires BeautifulSoup4 and requests libraries

## Task Priority
Priority: Medium
