## üöÄ **NEXT SESSION FOCUS: MULTIPLAYER PROTOTYPE**

### **Primary Objective**
Build a working 2-4 player movement and combat synchronization system

### **Key Multiplayer Features to Implement**
1. **Real-time Player Movement** - Synchronized position updates with client-server validation
2. **Auto-Combat System** - Enemies spawn in waves and automatically engage players
3. **OSRS Accuracy** - Combat damage and XP gain using exact OSRS Wiki formulas
4. **Performance Target** - Maintain 45+ FPS with multiple players and enemies

### **Success Criteria for Next Session**
- [ ] 2+ players can move simultaneously without desync issues
- [ ] Enemy waves spawn with escalating difficulty
- [ ] Combat damage calculations match OSRS Wiki specifications
- [ ] XP progression follows authentic OSRS rates
- [ ] System maintains stable performance throughout gameplay

## üéÆ **Multiplayer Development Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Core Movement (2-3 hours)**
1. Implement client movement message handlers
2. Add server-side movement validation (speed limits, boundaries)
3. Create position broadcasting to connected players
4. Test 2+ player simultaneous movement

### **Phase 2: Auto-Combat (1-2 hours)** 
1. Enhance wave spawning with enemy positioning
2. Implement automatic target acquisition for enemies
3. Add OSRS-accurate damage calculations
4. Create XP gain and level progression feedback

### **Phase 3: UI & Feedback (1 hour)**
1. Display health bars above players and enemies
2. Show real-time damage numbers and XP notifications
3. Add wave progress and level indicators
4. Test full multiplayer gameplay loop

## üîß **Known Issues & Recommendations**

### **Minor Test Failures (Non-blocking)**
- ECS startup timing validation needs adjustment
- Error handling edge cases in sync operations  
- Can be addressed in parallel with multiplayer development

### **Performance Optimization Opportunities**
- ECS system parallelization for even better performance
- Component dirty tracking to reduce sync overhead
- Adaptive frame rate scaling based on player count

### **Multiplayer Considerations**
- Client-side prediction for smooth movement
- Lag compensation for combat actions
- Connection quality monitoring and graceful degradation

## üéØ **Recommended Next Session Approach**

1. **Start with Movement** - Get basic 2-player movement working first
2. **Validate Performance** - Confirm FPS maintains 45+ with multiple players
3. **Add Combat** - Implement auto-targeting and damage systems
4. **Test Integration** - Full multiplayer gameplay validation
5. **Document Progress** - Update status for subsequent development phases

**This foundation is solid and ready for exciting multiplayer features! üöÄ**
